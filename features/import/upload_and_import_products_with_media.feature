Feature: Upload and import products with media
  In order to easily import existing product media
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to upload and import products along with media

    When I upload and import the file "caterpillar_import.zip"
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_product_import" job to finish
    Then there should be 3 products
    And product "CAT-001" should be enabled
    And product "CAT-002" should be enabled
    And product "CAT-003" should be enabled
    And the family of "CAT-001" should be "boots"

    And the category of "CAT-002" should be "winter_collection"
    And the category of "CAT-003" should be "winter_collection"
