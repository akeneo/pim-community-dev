    And the following product:
      | sku           | categories |
      | akeneo_tshirt | tshirts    |

    Given I should get the following product drafts after apply the following updater to it:
      | product       | actions                                                                                                                   | result | username |
      | akeneo_tshirt | [{"type": "set_data", "field": "length", "data": {"data": 12.0000, "unit": "CENTIMETER"}, "locale": null, "scope": null}] | {}     | Mary     |
    And I should get the following proposals:
      | product        | username | result                                                                                                                                                                                          |
      | akeneo_tshirt  | Mary     | {"values": {"length": [{"locale": null, "scope": null, "data": {"data":"12.0000", "unit":"CENTIMETER"}}]}, "review_statuses": {"length": [{"locale": null, "scope": null, "status": "draft"}]}} |

    Given the following product values:
      | product       | attribute | value              |
      | akeneo_tshirt | length    | 15.0000 CENTIMETER |
