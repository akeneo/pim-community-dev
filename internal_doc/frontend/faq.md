# Frequently asked questions

## How to get help?

### Slack channel

You can join the **#pim-frontend** channel on slack to ask any frontend-related questions.

It's also a good place to share ideas and improvements with your teammates or notify people of what you are working on (design system, etc...)

### Frontend guild

There is a guild that regroups teammates from every squad to discuss ongoing initiatives or suggests ideas for the evolution of the PIM frontend stack.

Meetings are scheduled every two weeks and you can ask **@samir.boulil** or your engineering manager to add you to the guild events.

Previous meeting notes are available to everyone [here](https://www.notion.so/akeneo/b9f094e2f6ce442389426a0b70cee812).

## How does localization work?

Translation files are part of the `Resources/translations/` folder of each Symfony bundle, the only file that needs to be updated is `jsmessages.en_US.yml`.

Translations are managed with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) and contributors can translate all the original texts there.
