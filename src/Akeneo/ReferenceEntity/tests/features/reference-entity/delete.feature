Feature: Delete a reference entity
  In order to keep my reference entities up to date
  As a user
  I want to delete a reference entity

  Background:
    Given a valid reference entity
  @acceptance-back
  Scenario: Delete a reference entity
    When the user deletes the reference entity "designer"
    Then there should be no reference entity "designer"

  @acceptance-back
  Scenario: User can't delete a Reference Entity if it is used in any Record Attribute on a Reference Entity
    Given the following record attributes:
      | entity_identifier | code   | labels                                 | required | order | value_per_channel | value_per_locale | record_type |
      | designer          | mentor | {"en_US": "Mentor", "fr_FR": "Mentor"} | false    | 2     | false             | false            | designer    |
    When the user deletes the reference entity "designer"
    Then there should be a validation error on the property '' with message 'You can not delete this entity because reference entity attributes are related to this entity'
    And there is a reference entity "designer" with:
      | identifier | labels                                       | image |
      | designer   | {"en_US": "Designer", "fr_FR": "Concepteur"} | null  |
