Feature: Revert product attributes to a previous version
  In order to manage versioning products
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to revert product attributes to a previous version

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  @skip @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-3351
  Scenario: Successfully revert a product with prices and leave them empty
    And the following product:
    | sku   | name-fr_FR | family |
    | jeans | Nice jeans | pants  |
    When I edit the "jeans" product
    And I fill in the following information:
    | Name | Really nice jeans |
    And I save the product
    And the history of the product "jeans" has been built
    And I open the history
    Then I should see 2 versions in the history
    When I revert the product version number 1
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I visit the "Marketing" group
    Then the product "jeans" should have the following values:
    | price      |            |
    | name-fr_FR | Nice jeans |

  Scenario: Successfully revert a price attribute
    Given the following product:
    | sku     | family | price  |
    | t-shirt | tees   | 49 EUR |
    Given I am on the "t-shirt" product page
    And I visit the "Marketing" group
    And I change the "Price" to "39 EUR"
    And I save the product
    And the history of the product "t-shirt" has been built
