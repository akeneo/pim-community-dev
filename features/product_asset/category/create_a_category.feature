  In order to provide a tree of my asset categories
  As an asset manager
  I need to be able to create a new asset category tree or a node of a category tree

  Background:
    Given the "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Pamela"

  Scenario: Create an asset category tree

    When I fill in the following information:
      | Code | newcategory |
    And I save the asset category
    Then I should be on the asset category "newcategory" edit page
    And I should see the flash message "Tree successfully created"

  Scenario: Create an asset category node
    Given I am on the asset category "images" node creation page
    When I fill in the following information:
      | Code | logo |
    And I save the asset category
    Then I should see the flash message "Category successfully created"
    And I should be on the asset category "logo" edit page

  Scenario: Create an asset category tree and assign an asset to it
    Given I am on the asset category tree creation page
    When I fill in the following information:

    Then I should be on the asset category "newcategory" edit page
    And I should see the flash message "Tree successfully created"
