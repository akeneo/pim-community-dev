Feature: Export products according to their statuses
  In order to use the enriched product data
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export the products according to their statuses

  Background:
    Given an "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following family:
      | code    | requirements-mobile |
      | rangers | sku, name           |
    And the following products:
      | sku      | enabled | family  | categories        | name-en_US    |
      | SNKRS-1B | 1       | rangers | summer_collection | Black rangers |
      | SNKRS-1R | 0       | rangers | summer_collection | Black rangers |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Export only enabled products
    Given the following job "csv_footwear_product_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/product_export/product_export.csv |
      | enabled  | enabled                                 |
    When I am on the "csv_footwear_product_export" export job page
    And I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_product_export" job to finish
    Then exported file of "csv_footwear_product_export" should contain:
    """
    sku;categories;enabled;family;groups;name-en_US
    SNKRS-1B;summer_collection;1;rangers;;Black rangers
    """

  Scenario: Export only disabled products
    Given the following job "csv_footwear_product_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/product_export/product_export.csv |
      | enabled  | disabled                                |
    When I am on the "csv_footwear_product_export" export job page
    And I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_product_export" job to finish
    Then exported file of "csv_footwear_product_export" should contain:
    """
    sku;categories;enabled;family;groups;name-en_US
    SNKRS-1R;summer_collection;0;rangers;;Black rangers
    """

  Scenario: Export products no matter their statuses
    Given the following job "csv_footwear_product_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/product_export/product_export.csv |
      | enabled  | all                                     |
    When I am on the "csv_footwear_product_export" export job page
    And I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_product_export" job to finish
    Then exported file of "csv_footwear_product_export" should contain:
    """
    sku;categories;enabled;family;groups;name-en_US
    SNKRS-1B;summer_collection;1;rangers;;Black rangers
    SNKRS-1R;summer_collection;0;rangers;;Black rangers
    """
