      | transport  | Transport  | prices       | yes                    |
    And the following "margin" attribute options: Black and Green

    And the following products:

    And I am logged in as "Mary"

  Scenario: Successfully filter products with the sames attributes
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Transport"
    And I filter by "Transport" with value "= 15 EUR"
    And I show the filter "Margin"
    And I filter by "Margin" with value "= 7 EUR"
    Then the grid should contain 3 elements
    And I should see entities "MUG-2" and "MUG-3" and "MUG-4"
    And I hide the filter "Transport"
    And I hide the filter "Margin"

  Scenario: Successfully filter product without commons attributes
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Transport"
    And I filter by "Transport" with value "= 30 EUR"
    And I show the filter "Margin"
    And I filter by "Margin" with value "= 7 EUR"
    Then the grid should contain 0 elements
    And I hide the filter "Transport"
    And I hide the filter "Margin"

  Scenario: Successfully filter only one product
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Transport"
    And I filter by "Transport" with value "= 2 EUR"
    And I show the filter "Margin"
    And I filter by "Margin" with value "= 7 EUR"
    Then the grid should contain 1 elements
    And I should see entities "MUG-1"
    And I hide the filter "Transport"
    And I hide the filter "Margin"
