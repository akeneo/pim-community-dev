Feature: Validate editing common attributes of multiple products
  In order to update multiple products with valid data
  As a product manager
  I need values to be validated when editing common attributes of products

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | code      | label     | type     | allowed_extensions | date_min   | max_characters |
      | available | Available | boolean  |                    |            |                |
      | date      | Date      | date     |                    | 2014-01-01 |                |
      | file      | File      | file     | gif                |            |                |
      | info      | Info      | textarea |                    |            | 25             |
    And the following family:
      | code          | attributes                                                                                                             |
      | master_family | sku, side_view, length, weather_conditions, number_in_stock, price, manufacturer, comment, available, date, file, info |
    And the following products:
      | sku      | family        |
      | boots    | master_family |
      | sneakers | master_family |
      | sandals  | master_family |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the products page

  Scenario: Successfully mass edit a boolean attribute
    Given I mass-edit products boots and sneakers
    And I choose the "Edit common attributes" operation
    And I display the Available attribute
    And I check the "Available" switch
    And I move on to the next step
    And I wait for the "edit-common-attributes" mass-edit job to finish
    Then attribute Available of "boots" should be "true"
    And attribute Available of "sneakers" should be "true"
    When I am on the products page
    And I mass-edit products boots, sandals and sneakers
    And I choose the "Edit common attributes" operation
    And I display the Available attribute
    And I uncheck the "Available" switch
    And I move on to the next step
    And I wait for the "edit-common-attributes" mass-edit job to finish
    Then attribute Available of "boots" should be "false"
    And attribute Available of "sandals" should be "false"
    And attribute Available of "sneakers" should be "false"
