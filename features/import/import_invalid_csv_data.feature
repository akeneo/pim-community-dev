Feature: Handle import of invalid CSV data
  In order to ease the correction of an invalid CSV file import
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to download a CSV file containing all invalid data of an import

  Background:
    Given the "clothing" catalog configuration

  Scenario: From an asset category CSV import, create an invalid data file and be able to download it
    Given the following CSV file to import:
      """
      code;parent;label-en_US
      asset_main_catalog;;Asset main catalog
      images;asset_main_catalog;Images
      invalid code;images;Invalid data
      situ;images;In situ pictures
      prioritized_images;NO_PARENT;Prioritised images
      """
    And the following job "csv_clothing_asset_category_import" configuration:
      | filePath | %file to import% |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I launch the "csv_clothing_asset_category_import" import job
    And I wait for the "csv_clothing_asset_category_import" job to finish
    Then I should see the text "Download invalid data"
    And the invalid data file of "csv_clothing_asset_category_import" should contain:
      """
      code;parent;label-en_US
      invalid code;images;Invalid data
      prioritized_images;NO_PARENT;Prioritised images
