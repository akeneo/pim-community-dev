  In order to update many products with the same information
  As a product manager

    And the following family:
      | code       | attributes                                                       |
      | high_heels | sku, name, description, price, rating, size, color, manufacturer |
    And the following attributes:
      | code         | label       | type   | metric family | default metric unit | families                 |
      | weight       | Weight      | metric | Weight        | GRAM                | boots, sneakers, sandals |
      | heel_height  | Heel Height | metric | Length        | CENTIMETER          | high_heels, sandals      |
      | buckle_color | Buckle      | text   |               |                     | high_heels               |
    And the following product groups:
      | code          | label         | axis  | type    |
      | variant_heels | Variant Heels | color | VARIANT |
    And the following variant group values:
      | group         | attribute   | value         |
      | variant_heels | heel_height | 12 CENTIMETER |
    And the following products:
      | sku            | family     | color  | groups        |
      | boots          | boots      |        |               |
      | sneakers       | sneakers   |        |               |
      | sandals        | sandals    |        |               |
      | pump           |            |        |               |
      | highheels      | high_heels | red    | variant_heels |
