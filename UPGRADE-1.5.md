## Oro Platform Bundles

Akeneo PIM is based on a fork of a very old beta5 version of oro/platform (2013/10).

We started the development of Akeneo PIM by actively contributing to oro/platform and by upgrading the platform each week.

The use of the platform drastically speed up our first stages to create Akeneo PIM, especially to manage users, security and to provide UI elements.

During the end of 2013, it appeared that our first stable release ETA (2014/01) was incompatible with the stable platform ETA (2014/04).

So we've created a fork to be able to stabilize, tweak and fix this version to make our application production ready.

Then we strongly focused on the Akeneo PIM development to build our first stable versions.

The gap between our forked version and the stable platform became bigger and bigger (the migration cost too).

We had customers in production and the migration would imply a lot of impacts so we never upgraded the platform.

The overall strategy was to reduce dependencies to our very old beta platform to be able at some point to migrate to a stable and recent platform.

So, in Akeneo PIM 1.x versions, to reduce the dependencies, ease the maintenance and enhance performance, we dropped several old oro bundles we don't even use.

In the v1.5, we move these bundles from our fork to our main repository to ease the cleanup and make our technical stack more understandable.

## Architecture [WIP still in discussion, can evolve and change]

Once Oro bundles moved, there is the re-work strategy for v1.5.

The idea is to provide a cleaner and more understandable stack by removing override and "twin bundles".

There is the v1.4 version with Oro bundles moved in src,

## Partially fix BC breaks

If you have a standard installation with some custom code inside, the following command allows to update changed services or use statements.

**It does not cover all possible BC breaks, as the changes of arguments of a service, consider using this script on versioned files to be able to check the changes with a `git diff` for instance.**

Based on a PIM standard installation, execute the following command in your project folder:

```
    find ./src/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/EntityBundle\\DependencyInjection\\Compiler\\DoctrineOrmMappingsPass/StorageUtilsBundle\\DependencyInjection\\Compiler\\DoctrineOrmMappingsPass/g'
```
