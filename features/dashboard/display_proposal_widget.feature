Feature: Display proposal widget

  As a product manager
  I need to be able to see a widget with pending proposals on the dashboard

    Given the "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

    Then I should see the text "Proposals to review"
    And I should see the text "No proposals to review"

  Scenario: Successfully display all proposals that I can review
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following product:

      | my-tee-shirt | tees    | tees       |
    And the following product drafts:
