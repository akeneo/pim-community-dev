Feature: Create product models through CSV import
  In order to import product model
  As a catalog manager
  I need to be able to import product models with valid data

  Background:
    Given the "catalog_modeling" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Skip a product model saving if its parent is the last product model in the tree (it should be a product variant instead).
    Given the following CSV file to import:
      """
      code;parent;family_variant;categories;sku;eu_shoes_size
      code-001;;shoes_size;master_men;;
