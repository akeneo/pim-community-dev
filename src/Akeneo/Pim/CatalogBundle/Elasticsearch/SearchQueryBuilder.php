/**
 * TODO: /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *
 * For now we call this class "Builder", because that's what it does. It builds iteratively the final ES query
 * and renders it as a php array when needed. Instances of this class are set in the filters (setQueryBuilder) so that
 * each filters has the possibility to add its own small condition to the query thanks to this SQB object.
 *
 * That is fine, and that's what we did in the previous version. But what we want to do instead is get rid of this
 * Search Query builder class and have each of the filters capable of modifying the data directly (because they are the
 * real builder parts in this architecture). So this class only becomes a data holder (which filter are allowed to
 * modify)and is capable of returning a full featured working query using getQuery(). This SearchQuery could easily
 * implement a more generic class which interface could support Doctrine ORM Queries, etc.. just something generic
 * enough.
 *
 * TODO: /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *
 * This stateful class holds the multiple parts of an Elastic Search search query.
 *
 * In two different arrays, it keeps track of the conditions where:
 * - a property should be equal to a value (ES filter clause)
 * - a property should *not* be equal to a value (ES must_not clause)

     * Adds a should clause to the query
     *
     * Warning: in the context of the PIM, a request containing a should clause is subject to a lot of side effects.
     * For instance, in one filter you want to filter on the property A with 2 possible values: A = 1 || A = 2
     * you could do the folowing:
     * `sqb->addShould([
     *  [
     *   'terms' => [
     *      'A' => 1
     *    ]
     *  ],
     *  [
     *   'terms' => [
     *      'A' => 1
     *    ]
     *  ]);`
     *
     * Later on, with another filter but the same sqb, you want to filter on property B: B = 1 ||Â B =2
     * again, you would do the following:
     * `sqb->addShould([
     *  [
     *   'terms' => [
     *      'A' => 1
     *    ]
     *  ],
     *  [
     *   'terms' => [
     *      'A' => 1
     *    ]
     *  ]);`
     *
     * The resulting logical request looks like this: A = 1 || A = 2 || B = 1 || B = 2 where in fact what the user meant
     * was (A = 1 || A = 2) && (B = 1 || B = 2)
