# To have more details on the effect of this "pim_job_product_batch_size", on performances
# memory leak, please have a look at this documentation part:
# https://docs.akeneo.com/latest/technical_architecture/performances_guide/batch_page_size.html
#
# Note to the core developers:
# The pim_job_product_batch_size has been changed from 100 to 10 at the beginning of 2018
# already, because of fear of generating memory leak.
# Now that we have more feedback, it seems to create more problem than real gain in term
# of performances. Moreover this value was forced at 100 for our cloud customers, so this
# was creating inconsistency in our installed base. So we are reverting it back to 100.
#
# So if you want to change it, do that only for major version and check with the tech team.
