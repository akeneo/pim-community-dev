Feature: Configure export of products media
  In order to control the data I get from a product export
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to configure a product export regarding media export policy

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following jobs:
      | connector             | type   | alias               | code                | label                        |
      | Akeneo XLSX Connector | export | xlsx_product_export | xlsx_product_export | XSLX footwear product export |
    And the following products:
      | sku           | name-en_US    | price-EUR | size | color | side_view             | family | categories        |
      | gothic_boot_1 | Gothic Boot A | 19.99     | 35   | black | %fixtures%/akeneo.jpg | boots  | winter_collection |
      | gothic_boot_2 | Gothic Boot B | 24.99     | 35   | black | %fixtures%/akeneo.jpg | boots  | winter_collection |
      | gothic_boot_3 | Gothic Boot C | 29.99     | 35   | black | %fixtures%/akeneo.jpg | boots  | winter_collection |
      | gothic_boot_4 | Gothic Boot D | 49.99     | 35   | black | %fixtures%/akeneo.jpg | boots  | winter_collection |

  Scenario: Successfully export products in csv with media
    Given the following job "csv_footwear_product_export" configuration:
      | filePath   | %tmp%/product_export/product_export.csv |
      | with_media | yes                                     |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the "csv_footwear_product_export" export job page
    And I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_product_export" job to finish
    Then I should see the text "Download generated archive"
    And export directory of "csv_footwear_product_export" should contain the following file:
      | product_export.csv |
    And export directory of "csv_footwear_product_export" should contain the following media:
      | files/gothic_boot_1/side_view/akeneo.jpg |
      | files/gothic_boot_2/side_view/akeneo.jpg |
      | files/gothic_boot_3/side_view/akeneo.jpg |
