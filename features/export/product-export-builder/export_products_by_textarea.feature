    And the following family:
      | code    | requirements-mobile | attributes |
      | rangers | sku,name            | sku,name   |
    And the following products:
      | sku      | enabled | family  | categories        | description-en_US-mobile |
      | SNKRS-1B | 1       | rangers | summer_collection | Awesome                  |
      | SNKRS-1R | 1       | rangers | summer_collection | Awesome description      |
      | SNKRS-1N | 1       | rangers | summer_collection |                          |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
