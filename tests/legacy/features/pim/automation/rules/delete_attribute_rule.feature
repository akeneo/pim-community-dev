Feature: Delete a rule
  In order ease the enrichment of the catalog
  As a regular user
  I need to be able to delete a rule

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Successfully delete rules of an attribute
    Given the following product rule definitions:
      """
      set_tees_description:
        priority: 10
        conditions:
          - field:    categories
            operator: IN
            value:
              - tees
        actions:
          - type:  set
            field: description
            value: an other description
            locale: fr_FR
            scope: tablet
      """
    And I am on the "description" attribute page
    And I visit the "Rules" tab
    And I click on the "Delete" action of the row which contains "set_tees_description"
    And I should see the text "Confirm deletion"
    And I should see the text "Are you sure you want to delete this rule?"
    And I confirm the deletion
    Then I should see the text "No rule found"
