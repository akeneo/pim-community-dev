Feature: Export asset variations
  In order to be able to access and modify asset data outside PIM
  As an asset manager
  I need to be able to import and export asset variations

  Scenario: Successfully export asset variation in CSV
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following job "csv_clothing_asset_variation_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/asset_export/asset_variation_export.csv |
    And I am logged in as "Pamela"
    And I am on the "csv_clothing_asset_variation_export" export job page
    When I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "csv_clothing_asset_variation_export" job to finish
    And I should see "read 34"
    And I should see "written 34"
    Then file "%tmp%/asset_export/asset_variation_export.csv" should contain 35 rows
    Then exported file of "csv_clothing_asset_variation_export" should contain:
    """

  Scenario: Successfully export asset variation in XLSX
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following job "xlsx_clothing_asset_variation_export" configuration:
