    And I select the attribute type "Identifier"
    Then I should see the Max characters, Validation rule and Searchable fields
    And the fields Unique, Scope, Usable as grid column and Usable as grid filter should be disabled

  Scenario: Succesfully create an identifier field
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
