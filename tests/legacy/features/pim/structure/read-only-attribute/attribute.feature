Feature: Display available field options
  In order to create a read only attribute
  As a product manager
  I need to see and manage the option 'Read only'

  Background:

  Scenario: Successfully set attribute to read only
    Given I am on the "description" attribute page
    And I check the "Read only" switch
    And I save the "attribute"
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved change"
    When I am on the "my-jacket" product page
    Then the field Description should be disabled
