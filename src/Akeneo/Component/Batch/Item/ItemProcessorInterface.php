 * oriented processing scenario.  It should be noted that while it's possible to return
 * a different type than the one provided, it's not strictly necessary.  Furthermore,
 * returning null indicates that the item should not be continued to be processed.

 * Inspired by Spring Batch  org.springframework.batch.item.ItemProcessor
