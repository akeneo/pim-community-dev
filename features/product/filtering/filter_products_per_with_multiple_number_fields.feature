      | supplier   | Supplier   | number       | yes                    |
    And the following "component" attribute options: Black and Green
    And the following "supplier" attribute options: Black and White and Red
    And the following products:
      | sku    | family    | supplier    | component |
      | BOOK   | library   |             |           |

      | EMPTY  | Empty  |                     | X_SELL  |                                    |
    And I am logged in as "Mary"

  Scenario: Successfully filter products with the sames attributes
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Supplier"
    And I filter by "Supplier" with value "03"
    And I show the filter "Component"
    And I filter by "Component" with value "16"
    Then the grid should contain 3 elements
    And I should see entities "MUG-2" and "MUG-3" and "MUG-4"
    And I hide the filter "Supplier"
    And I hide the filter "Component"

  Scenario: Successfully filter product without commons attributes
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Supplier"
    And I filter by "Supplier" with value "01"
    And I show the filter "Component"
    And I filter by "Component" with value "16"
    Then the grid should contain 0 elements
    And I hide the filter "Supplier"
    And I hide the filter "Component"

  Scenario: Successfully filter only one product
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Supplier"
    And I filter by "Supplier" with value "12"
    And I show the filter "Component"
    And I filter by "Component" with value "16"
    Then the grid should contain 1 elements
    And I should see entities "MUG-1"
    And I hide the filter "Supplier"
    And I hide the filter "Component"
