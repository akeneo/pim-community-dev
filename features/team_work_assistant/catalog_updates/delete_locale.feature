      | Collection Summer 2030 | julia | 2030-10-28 | Please do your best to finish before Summer. | ecommerce | fr_FR  | [{"field":"price", "operator":"=", "value": {"amount": 5, "locale": "USD"}}] |
      | Collection Winter 2030 | julia | 2030-08-28 | Please do your best to finish before Winter. | mobile    | en_US  | [{"field":"family.code", "operator":"IN", "value": ["tshirt"]}]              |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Remove a locale used as project filter
    Given I am on the "ecommerce" channel page
    When I change the "Locales" to "Breton (France)"
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should see the text "Channel successfully updated"
    When I am on the dashboard page
    Then I should not see the "Collection Summer 2030" project in the widget
    But I should see the "Collection Winter 2030" project in the widget
    When I am on the products page
    And I switch view selector type to "Projects"
    Then I should not see the "Collection Summer 2030" project
    But I should see the "Collection Winter 2030" project
