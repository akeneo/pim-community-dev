Feature: Display the localized product history
  In order to have complete localized UI
  As a product manager
  I need to have show localized values

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | code   | label-en_US | label-fr_FR | type                         | decimals_allowed | negative_allowed | default_metric_unit | metric_family | group |
      | number | Number      | Nombre      | pim_catalog_number           | 1                | 0                |                     |               | other |
      | metric | Metric      | Metrique    | pim_catalog_metric           | 1                | 1                | GRAM                | Weight        | other |
      | price  | Price       | Prix        | pim_catalog_price_collection | 1                |                  |                     |               | other |
    And I am logged in as "admin"
    And the following CSV file to import:
      """
      sku;price-EUR;price-USD;metric;metric-unit;number
      boots;20.80;25.35;12.1234;GRAM;98.7654
      """
    And the following job "csv_footwear_product_import" configuration:
      | filePath | %file to import% |
    When I am on the "csv_footwear_product_import" import job page
    And I launch the import job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_product_import" job to finish
    And I logout

    Then there should be 1 update
    And I should see history:
