Batch Library
=============

Batch architecture library inspired by Spring Batch.

See http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/domain.html for an explanation of the Domain Language objects you will find.

A [Symfony Bundle](https://github.com/akeneo/BatchBundle) also exists to integrate this component in your Symfony project.

Akeneo PIM
----------

Originally written to be used in [Akeneo PIM](https://www.akeneo.com/).

This extraction aims to make it usable outside of the Akeneo PIM project.

Please consider that this process is still in a very experimental stage.

We don't have all the tests and automation which could ensure that this component will work smoothly outside of the Akeneo PIM full stack.
