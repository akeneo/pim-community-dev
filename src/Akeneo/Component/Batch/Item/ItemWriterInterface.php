/**
 * Interface for generic output operations.
 *
 * Class implementing this interface will be responsible for serializing
 * objects as necessary.
 * Generally, it is responsibility of implementing class to decide which
 * technology to use for mapping and how it should be configured.
 *
 * The write method is responsible for making sure that any internal buffers are
 * flushed. If a transaction is active it will also usually be necessary to
 * discard the output on a subsequent rollback. The resource to which the writer
 * is sending data should normally be able to handle this itself.
 *
 * Inspired by Spring Batch  org.springframework.batch.item.ItemWriter
