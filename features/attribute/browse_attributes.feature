Feature: Browse attributes
  In order to check whether an attribute is available in the catalog
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to see attributes in the catalog

  Scenario: Successfully view, sort and filter attributes
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the attributes page
    Then the grid should contain 25 elements
    And I should see the columns Code, Label, Type, Scopable, Localizable and Group
    And I should see attributes sku, name, manufacturer, weather_conditions, description, price, rating, side_view, top_view, size, color, lace_color, length, number_in_stock, heel_color, sole_color, sole_fabric, lace_fabric, cap_color, rate_sale, weight and 123
    And the rows should be sorted ascending by Code
    And I should be able to sort the rows by Code, Label, Scopable, Localizable and Group
    Then I should be able to use the following filters:
      | filter      | value  | result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
