Feature: Sort channels
  In order to sort channels in the catalog
  As a user
  I need to be able to sort channels by several columns in the catalog

  Background:
    Given there is no channel
    And the following categories:
      | code      | label      |
      | master    | Master     |
      | mobile    | Mobile     |
      | ipad      | IPad       |
      | ecommerce | E-Commerce |
    And the following channels:
      | code | label | locales      | category  |
      | FOO  | foo Â  | fr_FR, en_US | master    |
      | BAR  | bar   | de_DE        | ecommerce |
      | BAZ  | baz   | fr_FR        | mobile    |
      | QUX  | qux   | en_US        | ipad      |
    And I am logged in as "admin"

  Scenario: Successfully display the sortable columns
    Given I am on the channels page
    Then the datas can be sorted by code, label and category tree
    And the datas are sorted ascending by code
    And I should see sorted channels BAR, BAZ, FOO and QUX

  Scenario: Successfully sort channels by code ascending
    Given I am on the channels page
    When I sort by "code" value ascending
    Then I should see sorted channels BAR, BAZ, FOO and QUX

  Scenario: Successfully sort channels by code descending
    Given I am on the channels page
    When I sort by "code" value descending
    Then I should see sorted channels QUX, FOO, BAZ and BAR

  Scenario: Successfully sort channels by label ascending
    Given I am on the channels page
    When I sort by "label" value ascending
    Then I should see sorted channels BAR, BAZ, FOO and QUX

  Scenario: Successfully sort channels by label descending
    Given I am on the channels page
    When I sort by "label" value descending
    Then I should see sorted channels QUX, FOO, BAZ and BAR

  Scenario: Successfully sort channels by tree ascending
    Given I am on the channels page
    When I sort by "category tree" value ascending
    Then I should see sorted channels BAR, QUX, FOO and BAZ

  Scenario: Successfully sort channels by tree descending
    Given I am on the channels page
    When I sort by "category tree" value descending
    Then I should see sorted channels BAZ, FOO, QUX and BAR
