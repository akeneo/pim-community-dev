Feature: Export groups in XLSX
  In order to be able to access and modify attributes data outside PIM
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export groups in XLSX

  Background:
    Given an "apparel" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Successfully export groups in xlsx with headers
    Given the following job "xlsx_group_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/xlsx_group_export/xlsx_group_export.xlsx |
    When I am on the "xlsx_group_export" export job page
    And I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "xlsx_group_export" job to finish
    Then exported xlsx file of "xlsx_group_export" should contain:
      | code       | type       | label-en_US | label-en_GB | label-fr_FR      | label-de_DE   |
      | similar    | similar    | Similar     | Similar     | Similaire        | Ähnlich       |
