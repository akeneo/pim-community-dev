Feature: Publish many products at once
  In order to freeze the product data I would use to export
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to publish several products at the same time

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | code      | label-en_US | type             | scopable | unique | date_min   | date_max   | group |

    And the following attributes:

      | max_length | Length      | pim_catalog_metric | 1        | Length        | METER               | 0                | 0                |            |            | info  |
    And the following attributes:
      | code       | label-en_US | type               | scopable | unique | negative_allowed | decimals_allowed | number_min | number_max | group |
      | popularity | Popularity  | pim_catalog_number | 1        | 0      | 0                | 0                | 1          | 10         | info  |
    And the following attributes:
      | code    | label-en_US | type                         | scopable | negative_allowed | decimals_allowed | number_min | number_max | group |

    And the following product:
      | sku       | family  | name-en_US | categories |
      | unionjack | jackets | UnionJack  | jackets    |

  Scenario: Allow to mass publish two products that are associated in two ways (jackadi => unionjack, unionjack => jackadi), I should be able to publish them twice
    Given I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I edit the "unionjack" product
    When I visit the "Associations" column tab
    And I visit the "Cross sell" association type
    And I press the "Add associations" button
    And I check the row "jackadi"
    And I press the "Confirm" button in the popin
    And I edit the "jackadi" product

    And I press the "Bulk actions" button

    Then I should see the text "The 2 selected products will be published"
    And I confirm mass edit
    And I wait for the "publish_product" job to finish
    And I am on the published products grid
    Then the grid should contain 2 elements
