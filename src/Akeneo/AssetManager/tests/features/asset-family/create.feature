  Scenario: Creating an asset family
    When the user creates an asset family "packshot" with:

      | {"en_US": "Stylist", "fr_FR": "Styliste"} | [{"product_selections": [{"field": "color", "operator": "=", "value": "red", "channel": "ecommerce", "locale": "fr_FR"}], "assign_assets_to": [{ "mode": "add", "attribute": "my_asset_collection" }]}] |
    Then there is an asset family "packshot" with:
      | identifier | labels                                    | product_link_rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

  Scenario: Creating an asset family with no labels
    When the user creates an asset family "designer" with:
      | labels |
      | {}     |

      | identifier | labels |
      | [designer] | {}     |

  @acceptance-back
  Scenario: Cannot create an asset family with invalid identifier
    When the user creates an asset family "invalid/identifier" with:

    Then there is a text attribute "label" in the asset family "designer" with:
      | code  | labels | is_required | order | value_per_channel | value_per_locale | max_length | type | is_textarea | is_rich_text_editor | validation_rule | regular_expression |
      | label | {}     | false       | 0     | false             | true             | null       | text | false       | false               | none            |                    |
    And the asset family "designer" should be:
      | identifier | labels                                     | attribute_as_label |
      | designer   | {"en_US": "Designer", "fr_FR": "Designer"} | label              |
