    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Browse ascendant and descendant entities on 2 levels of variation

    Then the variant navigation selected axis values for level 0 should be "Common"
    And the variant navigation axis name for level 1 should be "Color"
    And the variant navigation axis name for level 2 should be "Size"
    When I open the variant navigation children selector for level 1
    Then I should see the "Blue" element in the variant children selector for level 1
    And I should see the "Red" element in the variant children selector for level 1
    When I filter the variant navigation children selector for level 1 with text "pi"
    Then I should see the "Pink" element in the variant children selector for level 1
    When I filter the variant navigation children selector for level 1 with text "pi"
    Then I should not see the "Blue" element in the variant children selector for level 1
    When I select the child "Red" for level 1
    Then I should be on the product model "apollon_red" edit page

    Then I should see the "XXL" element in the variant children selector for level 2
    When I filter the variant navigation children selector for level 2 with text "xx"
    Then I should not see the "M" element in the variant children selector for level 2
    When I select the child "XXL" for level 2
    Then I should be on the product "1111111126" edit page
    And the variant navigation selected axis values for level 0 should be "Common"

    When I am on the "1111111127" product page
    And I visit the "Marketing" group
    Then I should see the text "This attribute can be updated on the attributes by Color"
    When I click on "This attribute can be updated on the attributes by Color" footer message of the field "Variation Name"
