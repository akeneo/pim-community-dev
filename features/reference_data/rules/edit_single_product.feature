  In order ease the enrichment of the catalog
  As a regular user
  I need that the relevant rules are executed and correctly applied to the product

    And I add the "french" locale to the "mobile" channel
    And I add the "french" locale to the "tablet" channel
    And the following "sole_color" attribute reference data: yellow, blue, red, orange
    And the following "sole_fabric" attribute reference data: chiffon, satin, wool, kevlar, leather, gore-tex, toile, cashmere
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
