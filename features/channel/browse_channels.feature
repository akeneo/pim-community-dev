Feature: Browse channels
  In order to list the existing channels for the catalog
  As a user
  I need to be able to see available channels

  Background:
    Given the following channels:
      | code | name  | locales      |
      | FOO  | foo Â  | fr_FR, en_US |
      | BAR  | bar   | de_DE        |
    And I am logged in as "admin"

  Scenario: Successfully display channels
    Given I am on the channels page
    Then I should see channels FOO and BAR
    And I should see the filters "Code", "Name" and "Category Tree"
