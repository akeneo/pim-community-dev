This is a create-react-app application, bootstraped with your **latest local build** of `akeneo-design-system`.

During the install, your latest build in `../lib` is copied to `./node_modules/akeneo-design-system`, 
you can then check this version of the DSM in real conditions.

## Install

```shell script
yarn install
```

## Tests

There is a few unit tests to check if the components are correctly exported and are working.

```shell script
yarn test
```

## Development

```shell script
yarn start
```

If you did a new build of `akeneo-design-system`, you can update it here with:
```shell script
yarn upgrade akeneo-design-system
```
