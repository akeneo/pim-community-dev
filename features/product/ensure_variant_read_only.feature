    And the following variant group values:
      | group         | attribute   | value            | locale | scope     |

    And the following products:
      | sku  | color | groups        |
      | sku1 | red   | tshirt_akeneo |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    When I am on the "sku1" product page
    And I switch the scope to "mobile"
    Then the fields Options, Dimension, Price in EUR, Length should be disabled
    Given I switch the locale to "fr_FR"
    Then the field name should be disabled
