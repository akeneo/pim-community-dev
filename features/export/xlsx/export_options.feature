Feature: Export options in XSLX
  In order to be able to access and modify options data outside PIM
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export options in XLSX

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Successfully export options in XLSX
    Given the following job "xlsx_footwear_option_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/option_export/option_export.xlsx |
    And I am on the "xlsx_footwear_option_export" export job page
    When I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "xlsx_footwear_option_export" job to finish
    Then exported xlsx file of "xlsx_footwear_option_export" should contain:
