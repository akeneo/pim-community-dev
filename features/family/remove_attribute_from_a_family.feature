Feature: Remove attribute from a family
  In order to correct myself when I have wrongly added an attribute into a family
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to remove an attribute from a family

  Background:
    Given the "default" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | label-en_US      | group | type             | code            |
      | Long Description | other | pim_catalog_text | longDescription |
      | Manufacturer     | other | pim_catalog_text | manufacturer    |
    And the following family:
      | code | attributes                   |
      | Bags | longDescription,manufacturer |
    And the following product:
      | sku            | family | longDescription | manufacturer |
      | bag-dolce-vita | Bags   | my description  | dolce        |
      | bag-noname     | Bags   | some random bag |              |
    And I am logged in as "Peter"

  Scenario: Successfully remove an attribute from a family and display it as removable from product
    Given I am on the "Bags" family page
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    When I remove the "manufacturer" attribute
    And I save the family
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    Then I should see the flash message "Attribute successfully removed from the family"
    And I should see attribute "Long Description" in group "Other"
    When I am on the "bag-dolce-vita" product page
    Then I should see a remove link next to the "Manufacturer" field
