Feature: Expose product data via a REST API
  In order to provide access to product data to an external application
  As a developer
  I need to expose product data via a REST API

  Scenario: Fail to authenticate an anonymous user
    Given I send a GET request to "api/rest/ecommerce/products.json"
    Then the response code should be 401

  Scenario: Successfully authenticate a user
    Given I am authenticating as "admin" with "admin_api_key" api key
    And I send a GET request to "api/rest/ecommerce/products.json"
    Then the response code should be 200

  Scenario: Successfully retrieve a product
    Given a "Car" product available in english and french
    And the following product attributes:
      | type   | label             | scopable | translatable |
      | prices | Price             | no       | no           |
      | text   | Color             | no       | yes          |
      | text   | Short description | yes      | yes          |
    And the following product values:
      | product | attribute         | locale | scope     | value                  |
      | Car     | Price             |        |           | 10000 EUR, 15000 USD   |

    And the response should be valid json
