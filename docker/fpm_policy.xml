        https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-10678 deactivate memory mapping strategy (called "map") for ImageMagick cache
        it does it by specifying a limit inferior to memory cache strategy
        1. ImageMagick will take "memory" cache strategy from 0 to 256 Mib cache size
        2. if cache size superior to 256 Mib, it will try "map" cache strategy, from 0 to 1 Mib, which is never the case
        3. as "map" is not possible, it takes "disk" cache strategy from 256 Mib to 3 GiB
        4 if cache size is superior to 4 Gib it fails with a catchable exception


        Map cache can produce very high IO usage during several minutes when used concurrently on big images, blocking the fpm child process several minutes.
        Also, our FPM container has not a very big memory limit configured, limiting the interest of memory mapping as soon as you have more than 2 concurrent images to transform.

        That's why it is deactivated in for fpm process.

    <policy domain="resource" name="map" value="1MiB" />

    <!--
       Safeguard to not exhaust resources on the transformation of an image. Indeed, ImageMagick transformation will not trigger a PHP timeout
       as the transformation is done in the function of an extension. As a consequence, it can take all the FPM child process and make the PIM unavailable.

       Do note that the time is global per process, and not by ImageMagick operation.
       That's why it is specified for FPM, but not in CLI where you can handle multiple images in a job.
