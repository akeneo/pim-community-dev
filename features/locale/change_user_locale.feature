Feature: Change user locale
  In order to change locale
  As an administrator

    And I am logged in as "Peter"

  Scenario: Successfully change my locale
    Given I edit my profile
    Then I visit the "Interfaces" tab
    And I fill in the following information:
     | Ui locale | fr_FR |
    And I save the user
    Then I should see "Collecter"
