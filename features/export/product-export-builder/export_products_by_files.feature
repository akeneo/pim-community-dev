Feature: Export products according to file media attribute
  In order to export specific products
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export the products according to file attribute values

  Background:
    Given an "apparel" catalog configuration
    And the following family:
      | code    | requirements-ecommerce | attributes                        |
      | rangers | sku,name               | attachment,description,name,price |
    And the following products:
      | sku        | enabled | family  | categories      | image                     | attachment             |
      | SNKRS-1C-s | 1       | rangers | 2014_collection | %fixtures%/SNKRS-1C-s.png | %fixtures%/akeneo.txt  |
      | SNKRS-1C-t | 1       | rangers | 2014_collection | %fixtures%/SNKRS-1C-t.png | %fixtures%/akeneo.txt  |
      | SNKRS-1R   | 1       | rangers | 2014_collection | %fixtures%/SNKRS-1R.png   |                        |
      | SNKRS-1S   | 1       | rangers | 2014_collection |                           | %fixtures%/akeneo2.txt |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Successfully export products by their file values without using the UI
    Given the following job "ecommerce_product_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/product_export/product_export.csv                                                                                          |
      | filters  | {"structure":{"locales":["en_US"],"scope":"ecommerce"},"data":[{"field": "attachment", "operator": "=", "value": "akeneo.txt"}]} |
    When I am on the "ecommerce_product_export" export job page
    And I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "ecommerce_product_export" job to finish
    Then exported file of "ecommerce_product_export" should contain:
    """
