Feature: Products datagrid views
  In order to easily manage different views in the product datagrid
  As a contributor
  I need to be able to create, update, apply and remove datagrid views

  # Override: CE datagrid_views.feature

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following products:
      | sku             | family   |
      | purple-sneakers | sneakers |
      | black-sneakers  | sneakers |
      | black-boots     | boots    |
    And I am logged in as "Mary"
    And I am on the products page

  Scenario: A contributor can create a product datagrid view
    Given I filter by "family" with operator "in list" and value "Sneakers"
    And I create the view:
      | new-view-label | Sneakers only |
    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the flash message "Datagrid view successfully created"
    And I should see the text "Sneakers only"
    And I should see products purple-sneakers and black-sneakers
    But I should not see product black-boots

  Scenario: A contributor can update a product datagrid view
    Given I filter by "family" with operator "in list" and value "Boots"
    And I create the view:
      | new-view-label | Some shoes |
    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the flash message "Datagrid view successfully created"
    And I should see the text "Some shoes"
    And I should see product black-boots
    But I should not see products purple-sneakers and black-sneakers
    When I hide the filter "family"
    And I show the filter "family"
    And I filter by "family" with operator "in list" and value "Sneakers"
    And I update the view
    And I apply the "Some shoes" view
    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the text "Some shoes"
    And I should see products purple-sneakers and black-sneakers
    But I should not see product black-boots

  Scenario: A contributor can delete a product datagrid view
    Given I filter by "family" with operator "in list" and value "Boots"
    And I create the view:
      | new-view-label | Boots only |
    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the flash message "Datagrid view successfully created"
    And I should see the text "Boots only"
    And I should see product black-boots
    But I should not see products purple-sneakers and black-sneakers
    When I delete the view
    And I confirm the deletion
    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the flash message "Datagrid view successfully removed"
    And I should see the text "Default view"
    But I should not see "Boots only"
    And I should see products black-boots, purple-sneakers and black-sneakers

  Scenario: A contributor can choose his default products datagrid view from his profile
    Given I filter by "family" with operator "in list" and value "Sneakers"
    And I create the view:
      | new-view-label | Sneakers only |
    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the flash message "Datagrid view successfully created"
    When I am on the User profile show page
    And I press the "Edit" button
    Then I should see the text "Edit user - Mary Smith"
    When I visit the "Additional" tab
    Then I should see the text "Default product grid view"
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Default product grid view | Sneakers only |
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    When I logout
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the products page
    Then I should see products black-boots, purple-sneakers and black-sneakers
    When I logout
    And I am logged in as "Mary"
    And I am on the products page
    Then I should see the text "Sneakers only"
    And I should see products purple-sneakers and black-sneakers
    But I should not see product black-boots
    When I press the "Reset" button
    Then I should see products black-boots, purple-sneakers and black-sneakers

  Scenario: A contributor can remove his default products datagrid view from his profile
    Given I filter by "family" with operator "in list" and value "Sneakers"
    And I create the view:
      | new-view-label | Sneakers only |
    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the flash message "Datagrid view successfully created"
    When I am on the User profile show page
    And I press the "Edit" button
    Then I should see the text "Edit user - Mary Smith"
    When I visit the "Additional" tab
    Then I should see the text "Default product grid view"
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Default product grid view | Sneakers only |
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."

    Then I should be on the products page
    And I should see the flash message "Datagrid view successfully removed"
    And I should see the text "Default view"
