Feature: Order product attributes
  In order to always have the same attribute fields order in each locale
  As a user
  I need to be able to set an order parameter which will manage fields order

  Scenario: Successfully update an attribute position
    Given a "Car" product available in english
    And the following attribute group:
      | name    |
      | General |
    And the following product attribute:
      | product | label         | group   |
      | Car     | Release Date | General |
    And I am logged in as "admin"
    When I am on the "Release date" attribute page
    And I change the attribute position to 40
    Then I should see "Attribute successfully saved"

  Scenario: Display a produt attribute fields ordered by their position
    Given a "Car" product available in english
    And the following attribute groups:
      | name    |
      | General |
      | Shape   |
    And the following product attributes:
      | product | label        | position | group   |
