Feature: Show asset collection preview
  In order to show the asset collection preview
  As an asset manager
  I need to be able to use the asset collection preview in product edit form

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following products:
      | sku   | family |
      | shirt | tees   |
    And I am logged in as "Pamela"
    And I am on the "shirt" product page
    And I visit the "Media" group
    And I start to manage assets for "Front view"
    And I check the row "chicagoskyline"
    And I check the row "akene"
    And I check the row "autumn"
    And I confirm the asset modification
    And I save the product

  Scenario: Successfully show the asset collection preview
    When I click on the "chicagoskyline" asset thumbnail
    Then I should see the text "Asset collection preview"
    And I should see the text "This is chicago!"

    Given I click on the "chicagoskyline" asset thumbnail

    Then I should see the text "Leaves and water"
    When I navigate to the right in the asset collection preview
    Then I should see the text "This is chicago!"
