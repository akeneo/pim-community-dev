Feature: Edit a locale specific value
  In order to enrich the catalog
  As a regular user
  I need to be able to edit a locale specific value only when editing in available locale

  Background:
    Given the "apparel" catalog configuration
    And the following family:
      | code          | attributes                     |
      | super_tshirts | sku,customs_tax,under_european_law |
    And the following products:
      | sku    | family        |
      | tshirt | super_tshirts |
    And I am logged in as "Mary"

  # @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-3298
  Scenario: Display the custom tax on the available locale
    Given I am on the "tshirt" product page
    And I visit the "Internal" group
    When I switch the locale to "de_DE"
    Then I should see the text "Zollsteuer"
    When I switch the locale to "en_US"
    Then I should see the text "This locale specific field is not available in this locale"
