Feature: Count products during a mass edit
  In order to understand the impacts of my selection during a mass edit
  As a product manager
  I need to know the numbers of products that are really impacted by my selection

  Background:
    Given a "catalog_modeling" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the products grid
    And I sort by "ID" value descending

  Scenario: Correctly counts the number of products impacted by the mass edit action when a user selects two product models and two products.
    Given I select rows apollon, aphrodite, Hat, Scarf
    And I press the "Bulk actions" button
    And I choose the "Edit common attributes" operation
    Then I should see the text "20 products"

  Scenario: Correctly counts the number of products impacted by the mass edit action when a user selects all products except one product and model and one product
    Given I select rows aphrodite
    And I select all entities
    And I unselect rows Bag, aphrodite
    And I press the "Bulk actions" button
    And I choose the "Edit common attributes" operation
    Then I should see the text "236 products"
