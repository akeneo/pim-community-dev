Feature: Edit common attributes of many products at once
  In order to update many products with the same information
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to edit common attributes of many products at once

  Background:
    Given a "apparel" catalog configuration
    And the following products:
      | sku          | family  | name-en_US     | name-de_DE          | customer_rating-ecommerce | customer_rating-print |
      | black_jacket | jackets | A black jacket | Eine schwarze Jacke | 1                         | 2                     |
      | white_jacket | jackets | A white jacket | Ein wei√üer Jacke    | 3                         | 4                     |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the products grid

  Scenario: Successfully mass edit scoped product values
    Given I switch the scope to "Print"
    And I select rows black_jacket and white_jacket
    And I press the "Bulk actions" button
    And I choose the "Edit attributes" operation
    Then I should see the text "Only the attributes belonging to the families of the selected products will be edited with the following data for the English (United States) locale and the Print channel."
    When I display the Customer rating attribute
    And I change the "Customer rating" to "5"
    And I confirm mass edit
    And I wait for the "edit_common_attributes" job to finish
    Then the unlocalized ecommerce customer_rating of "black_jacket" should be "[1]"
    And the unlocalized ecommerce customer_rating of "white_jacket" should be "[3]"
    And the unlocalized print customer_rating of "black_jacket" should be "[5]"
    And the unlocalized print customer_rating of "white_jacket" should be "[5]"

  Scenario: Successfully mass edit localized product values
    Given I switch the locale to "de_DE"
    When I switch the scope to "Ecommerce"
    And I select rows black_jacket and white_jacket
    And I press the "Bulk actions" button
    And I choose the "Edit attributes" operation
    Then I should see the text "Only the attributes belonging to the families of the selected products will be edited with the following data for the Deutsch (Deutschland) locale and the Ecommerce channel."
    When I display the Name attribute
    And I change the "Name" to "Une veste"
    And I confirm mass edit
    And I wait for the "edit_common_attributes" job to finish
    Then the german localizable value name of "black_jacket" should be "Une veste"
    And the german localizable value name of "white_jacket" should be "Une veste"
    And the english localizable value name of "black_jacket" should be "A black jacket"
    And the english localizable value name of "white_jacket" should be "A white jacket"
