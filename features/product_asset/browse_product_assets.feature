Feature: Browse product assets
  In order to list the existing product assets
  As an asset manager
  I need to be able to see product assets

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Pamela"

  Scenario: Successfully display product assets
    And I am on the "paint" asset page
    And I visit the "Variations" tab
    And I upload the reference file akene.jpg
    And I save the asset
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    And I should see "akene.jpg"
    And I am on the "chicagoskyline" asset page
    And I visit the "Variations" tab
    And I switch the locale to "de_DE"
    And I upload the reference file akene.jpg
    And I save the asset
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    And I should see "akene.jpg"
    And I visit the "Variations" tab
    And I switch the locale to "en_US"
    And I upload the reference file akene.jpg
    And I save the asset
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    And I should see "akene.jpg"
    And I am on the assets page
    Then the grid should contain 15 elements
    And I should see the columns Thumbnail, Code, Description, Tags, End of use, Created at and Last updated at
    And the row "paint" should contain the thumbnail for channel "mobile"
    And the row "chicagoskyline" should contain the thumbnail for channel "mobile" and locale "en_US"
    When I switch the locale to "de_DE"
    And I filter by "scope" with operator "equals" and value "Tablet"
    Then the row "paint" should contain the thumbnail for channel "tablet"
    And the row "chicagoskyline" should contain the thumbnail for channel "tablet" and locale "de_DE"
