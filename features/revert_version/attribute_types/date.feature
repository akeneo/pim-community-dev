Feature: Revert product attributes to a previous version
  In order to manage versioning products
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to revert product attributes to a previous version

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-3301
  Scenario: Successfully revert a product date and leave it empty
    And the following product:
    | sku           | family  |
    | akeneo-jacket | jackets |
    When I edit the "akeneo-jacket" product
    And I switch the scope to "mobile"
    And I change the "Release date" to "05/20/2014"
    And I save the product
    And the history of the product "akeneo-jacket" has been built
    And I open the history
    Then I should see 2 versions in the history
    When I revert the product version number 1
    Then the product "akeneo-jacket" should have the following values:
    | release_date-mobile | |

  Scenario: Successfully revert a date attribute with original empty value
    Given the following product:
    | sku           | family  | release_date-mobile |
    | akeneo-jacket | jackets |                     |
    And I am on the "akeneo-jacket" product page
    And I switch the scope to "mobile"
    When I change the "Release date" to "01/01/2001"
    And I save the product
    And the history of the product "akeneo-jacket" has been built
    And I open the history
    Then I should see 2 versions in the history
    When I revert the product version number 1
    Then the product "akeneo-jacket" should have the following values:
    | release_date-mobile | |

  Scenario: Successfully revert a date attribute with original non empty value
    Given the following product:
    | sku           | family  | release_date-mobile |
    | akeneo-jacket | jackets | 2011-08-17          |
    And I am on the "akeneo-jacket" product page
    And I switch the scope to "mobile"
    When I change the "Release date" to "01/01/2001"
    And I save the product
    And the history of the product "akeneo-jacket" has been built
    And I open the history
    Then I should see 2 versions in the history
    When I revert the product version number 1
    Then the product "akeneo-jacket" should have the following values:
    | release_date-mobile | 2011-08-17 |
