Feature: Export products according to simple select values
  In order to use the enriched product data
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export the products according to their simple selected option

  Background:
    Given the "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following products:
      | sku    | family | name-en_US | manufacturer | categories      |
      | BOOT-1 | boots  | The boot 1 | Nike         | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-2 | boots  | The boot 2 | Converse     | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-3 | boots  | The boot 3 |              | 2014_collection |
    And the following job "csv_footwear_product_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/product_export/footwear_product_export.csv |
