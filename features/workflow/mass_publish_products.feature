  Scenario: Successfully publish all products
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the products page
    And I mass-edit products unionjack and jackadi
    When I choose the "Publish products" operation

    And I choose the "Publish products" operation
    And I move on to the next step
    And I wait for the "publish" mass-edit job to finish
    Then I should see "You're not the owner of the product, you can't publish it"
    And I should see "skipped products 1"
    When I am on the published index page
    Then the grid should contain 2 elements

  Scenario: Publish nothing if the user is the owner of no product
