Feature: Create a user
  In order to manage the users and rights
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to create a user

  Background:

    And I am logged in as "Peter"

  Scenario: Successfully create a user

      | Last name         | Doe      |
      | Password          | DoeDoe   |
      | Re-enter password | DoeDoe   |
      | Status            | Inactive |
    And I scroll down
    And I fill in the following information:
      | E-mail | jack+doe@example.com |
    And I visit the "Groups and Roles" tab
    And I select the role "User"
    When I save the user
    Then there should be a "jack" user

  Scenario: Fail to create a user with an invalid email address
    Given I am on the user creation page
