Feature: Product category back to the grid
  In order to restore the product grid filters
  As a regular user
  I need to be able to set a category filter and retrieve it after going back to the page

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following products:
      | sku             | categories                           |
      | purple-sneakers | summer_collection                    |
      | black-sneakers  | summer_collection, winter_collection |
      | black-boots     |                                      |
    And I am logged in as "Mary"
    And I am on the products grid

    And I am on the products grid

    And I should not see products purple-sneakers and black-boots
