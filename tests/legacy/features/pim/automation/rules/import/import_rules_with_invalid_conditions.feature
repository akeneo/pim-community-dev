Feature: Import rules
  In order to fix incorrect product data
  As an administrator
  I need to know which rules are incorrect and why

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Peter"

  Scenario: Skip rules with unsupported integer value for attribute name in conditions
    Given the following product rule definitions:
      """
      sony_beautiful_description:
        priority: 10
        conditions:
          - field:    name
            operator: CONTAINS
            value:    Canon
            locale:   fr_FR
        actions:
          - type:   set
            field:  name
            value:  Super Name
            locale: en_US
      """
    And the following yaml file to import:
    """
    rules:
        canon_beautiful_description:
            conditions:
                - field:    name
                  operator: CONTAINS
                  value:    42
                  locale:   en_US
            actions:
                - type:  set
                  field: name
                  value: 42
                  locale: en_US
        sony_beautiful_description:
            conditions:
                - field:    name
                  operator: CONTAINS
                  value:    42
                  locale:   en_US
            actions:
                - type:  set
                  field: name
                  value: 42
                  locale: en_US
    """
    And the following job "clothing_rule_import" configuration:
      | storage | {"type": "local", "file_path": "%file to import%"} |
    When I am on the "clothing_rule_import" import job page
    And I launch the import job
    And I wait for the "clothing_rule_import" job to finish
    Then I should see the text "skipped 2"
    And I should see the text "conditions[0]: Property \"name\" expects a string as data, \"integer\" given."
    And I should see the text "actions[0]: The name attribute requires a string, a integer was detected."
