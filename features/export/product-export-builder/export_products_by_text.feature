Feature: Export products according to text attribute filter
  In order to export specific products
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export the products according to text attribute values

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following family:
      | code    | requirements-mobile | attributes |
      | rangers | sku                 | comment    |
    And the following products:
      | sku      | enabled | family  | categories        | comment         | name-en_US |
      | SNKRS-1B | 1       | rangers | summer_collection | Awesome         |            |
      | SNKRS-1R | 1       | rangers | summer_collection | Awesome product |            |
      | SNKRS-1N | 1       | rangers | summer_collection |                 |            |
      | SNKRS-1Z | 1       | rangers | summer_collection | This is nice    | Ranger 1Z  |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
