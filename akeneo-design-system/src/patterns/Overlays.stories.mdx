# Overlays

Overlays communicate information through a secondary window and allow the user to keep the context of a particular job. Use overlays when an action requires the userâ€™s full attention to prevent him from being distracted by the rest of the content.

## Usage

Overlays interrupt the user workflow by design. They are the most effective when a task must be completed before a user is allowed to continue. Although useful when used correctly, the overlay should be used with moderation to minimize the disruption of the user experience.

## Confirm Modal

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Confirm Modal">
    {args => {
      const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);
      const open = () => setOpen(true);
      const close = () => setOpen(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={close} illustration={<DeleteIllustration />}>
            <Surtitle>Products</Surtitle>
            <Title>Confirm deletion</Title>
            Are you sure you want to delete this product?
            <ButtonsContainer>
              <Button level="tertiary" onClick={close}>
                Cancel
              </Button>
              <Button level="danger" onClick={close}>
                Delete
              </Button>
            </ButtonsContainer>
          </Modal>
          <Button onClick={open}>Open Confirm Modal</Button>
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
