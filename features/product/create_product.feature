Feature: Product creation
  In order to add a non-imported product
  As a user
  I need to be able to manually create a product

  Background:

      | label       | required |
      | SKU         | yes      |

      | Description | no       |
    And I am logged in as "admin"

  Scenario: Successfully display all required attributes in the product creation form
    Given I am on the products page
    And I create a new product
    Then I should see the SKU, Reference and Family fields

  Scenario: Successfully create a product
    Given I am on the products page
    And I create a new product
    And I fill in the following information:
      | SKU               | barbecue  |
