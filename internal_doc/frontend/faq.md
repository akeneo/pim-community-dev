# Frequently asked questions

## How to get help?

### Slack channel

You can join the **#pim-frontend** channel on slack to ask any frontend related questions.

It's also a good place to share ideas and improvements with your teammates or notify people on what you are working on (design system, etc...)

### Frontend guild

There is a guild that regroup teammates from every squads to discuss ongoing initiatives or suggest ideas for the evolution of the PIM frontend stack.

Meetings are scheduled every two weeks and you can ask **@samir.boulil** or your engineering manager to add you to the guild events.

Previous meetings notes are available to everyone [here](https://www.notion.so/akeneo/b9f094e2f6ce442389426a0b70cee812).

## How does localization work?

Translation files are part of the `Resources/translations/` folder of each Symfony bundle, the only file that need to be updated is `jsmessages.en_US.yml`.

Translation are managed with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) and contributors can translate all the original texts there.
