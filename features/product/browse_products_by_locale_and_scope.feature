    And I am logged in as "admin"

  Scenario: Successfully display relevant products data on products page
    Given I am on the products page
    When I switch the locale to "en_US"
    And I filter by "Channel" with value "Ecommerce"
    Then I should see product "postit" with data postit, Post it, large.jpeg and My ecommerce description
    When I filter by "Channel" with value "Mobile"
    Then I should see product "postit" with data postit, Post it, small.jpeg and My mobile description
    When I switch the locale to "fr_FR"
    And I filter by "Channel" with value "Ecommerce"
    Then I should see product "postit" with data postit, Etiquette, large.jpeg and Ma description ecommerce
    When I filter by "Channel" with value "Mobile"
    Then I should see product "postit" with data postit, Etiquette, small.jpeg and Ma description mobile
