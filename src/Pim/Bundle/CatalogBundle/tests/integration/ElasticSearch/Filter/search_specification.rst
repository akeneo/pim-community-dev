Search specifications ElasticSearch on Akeneo
=============================================

Needs
-----
 - apply filter on all different attribute types
 - apply sorter on all sortable attribute types (excluding for example image and multi-select)

Implementation
--------------
Query vs filters
****************
Elasticsearch proposes two ways to search documents: filters and queries. According to the official documentation ( http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_queries_and_filters.html ), the two differences between them are:

 - relevancy: query computes relevancy (scoring) and filter no
 - full text search: filter is about exact value whereas query can do full text search (analyzed)

According to the documentation:

   "As a general rule, use query clauses for full-text search or for any condition that should affect
   the relevance score, and use filter clauses for everything else."

So in our case of the grid, where relevancy is not applied, Akeneo PIM's filters will be mostly implemented with
Elasticsearch filters, except for CONTAINS type filters that needs full-text search.


Analyzers and dynamic mapping
*****************************
Depending on the field format (string, number, date, etc....), some specific analyzers maybe needed. For example, in case of ``identifier``, a n-gram analyzer must be added to be able to search on substring. Another example are the strings that needs a multifield to store the tokenized version for full-text search purpose and an untokenized version for sorting purpose.

As new attributes can be added dynamically to Akeneo, we will use the dynamic mapping feature of Elasticsearch and provides specific suffix that will specify the analyzer to use.

For example:
 - description-text: the ``-text`` suffix is applied, meaning that we must apply a specific analyzer for text

Common elements
***************
Naming
~~~~~~
 - Elasticsearch fields for attribute follow this naming scheme:

``attribute_code-l-locale-s-scope-es_suffix``

Please note that locale code is prefixed by ``l-`` and scope code is prefixed by ``s-``, to avoid collision between them.

Fitering
~~~~~~~~
The following example are the content of the ``query`` node in Yaml representation of the Elasticsearch JSON DSL.

They can take two different forms in our case:

If there's no Akeneo filter needing full-text capability, we will perform a ``filtered``
search without query and with only a ``bool`` filter with ``must`` typed occurence of the following form (as
Akeneo product builder supported only AND relation between conditions):

.. code-block:: yaml

    filtered:
        filter:
            bool:
                must:
                    -
                        prefix:
                             name-text: "Tshirt"
                    -
                        term:
                            price-prices: 30

If we have one or more filter needing full-text capability, we will need to combine query
and filter with a ``bool`` query with ``must`` typed occurence of the following form:

.. code-block:: yaml

    filtered:
        query:
            bool:
                must:
                    -
                        match_phrase:
                            description-en_US-mobile-text_area: "30 pages"
                    -
                        match_phrase:
                            name-text: "canon"
        filter:
            bool:
                must:
                    -
                        prefix:
                            name-text: "Tshirt"
                    -
                        term:
                            price-prices: 30

Sorting
~~~~~~~
 - sorting will be applied with the following ``sort`` node:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sort:
        name-text: "asc"

Sorting and tokenization
........................
Tokenized fields cannot be used for sorting as they will generate wrong results (see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/multi-fields.html).

For those fields (mainly string fields), a multi-fields must be created with the untokenized value stored in a ``raw`` subfield.

In this case, the sort becomes:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sort:
        name-text.raw: "asc"

Text area
*********

:Apply: pim_catalog_textarea attributes
:Analyzer: HTML char filter + standard tokenizer + lowercase token filter

    Other fields analyzer:
     - raw: non-tokenized (Keyword Tokenizer) + lower case token filter
     - reverse: non-tokenized (Keyword Tokenizer) + reversing filter (Reverse Token Filter)

        minimum_should_match: 1

IN CHILDREN
~~~~~~~~~~~
:Type: filter

This operator is the same than ``IN``, but works by providing the full list of children ids from the product. We need to check performances on this one to see if there's no other way than using ``IN`` to achieve better performances if needed.

NOT IN CHILDREN
