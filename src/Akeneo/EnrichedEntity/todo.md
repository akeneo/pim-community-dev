- remove `back` from the php namespace
- See if it's possible to have the routing declared only in our bundle (we will see later with black hawks how to do it)
- Application/EnrichedEntity/Show/ShowEnrichedEntityHandler should handle only one command it should maybe return only a ReadModel
- Discuss about Domain/Model/EnrichedEntity/EnrichedEntity getters: they break the tell don't ask principle.
- rename Domain/Model/EnrichedEntity/EnrichedEntityIdentifier:fromString to create: we cannot create them another way
- create a read model for the read cases
- Move the InMemory repository in the business code
- Create builders for entities in the backend
