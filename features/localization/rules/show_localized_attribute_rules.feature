Feature: Show localized rules
  In order have localized UI
  As a regular user
  I need to see localized attribute values

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | code                   | label                  | type   | decimals_allowed | metric_family | default metric unit |
      | decimal_number         | decimal_number         | number | yes              |               |                     |
      | another_decimal_number | another_decimal_number | number | yes              |               |                     |
      | decimal_price          | decimal_price          | prices | yes              |               |                     |
      | decimal_metric         | decimal_metric         | metric | yes              | Length        | CENTIMETER          |
    And the following product rules:
      | code    | priority |
      | my_rule | 10       |
    And the following product rule conditions:
      | rule    | field          | operator | value |
      | my_rule | decimal_number | =        | 10.5  |
    And the following product rule setter actions:
      | rule    | field                  | value           |
      | my_rule | another_decimal_number | 5.56789         |
      | my_rule | decimal_price          | 12.5 EUR        |
      | my_rule | decimal_metric         | 10.5 CENTIMETER |
