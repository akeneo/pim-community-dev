Feature: Import families
  In order to reuse the families of my products
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to import families

  Scenario: Successfully update existing family and add a new one
    Given the "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following CSV file to import:
      """
      code;attributes;attribute_as_label;requirements-mobile;requirements-tablet;label-en_US
      heels;sku,name,manufacturer,heel_color;name;manufacturer;manufacturer,heel_color;Heels
      tractors;sku,name,manufacturer;name;;;Tractor
      """
    When the families are imported via the job csv_footwear_family_import
    Then there should be the following families:
      | code     | attributes                       | attribute_as_label | requirements-mobile | requirements-tablet         | label-en_US |
      | heels    | sku,name,manufacturer,heel_color | name               | sku,manufacturer    | sku,heel_color,manufacturer | Heels       |
      | tractors | sku,name,manufacturer            | name               | sku                 | sku                         | Tractor     |

  Scenario: Successfully import new family in XLSX
    Given the "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following XLSX file to import:
      """
      code;attributes;attribute_as_label;requirements-mobile;requirements-tablet;label-en_US
      tractors;sku,name,manufacturer;name;manufacturer;manufacturer;Tractors
      """
    When the families are imported via the job xlsx_footwear_family_import
    Then there should be the following family:
      | code     | attributes            | attribute_as_label | requirements-mobile | requirements-tablet | label-en_US |
      | tractors | sku,name,manufacturer | name               | sku,manufacturer    | sku,manufacturer    | Tractors    |
