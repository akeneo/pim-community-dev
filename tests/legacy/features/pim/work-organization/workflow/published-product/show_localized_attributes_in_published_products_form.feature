Feature: Show localized attributes in published products form
  In order have localized UI
  As a regular user
  I need to see localized attribute values

  Background:
    Given the "default" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | code           | label-en_US    | type                         | decimals_allowed | negative_allowed | metric_family | default_metric_unit | group |
      | decimal_price  | decimal_price  | pim_catalog_price_collection | 1                |                  |               |                     | other |
      | decimal_number | decimal_number | pim_catalog_number           | 1                | 0                |               |                     | other |
      | decimal_metric | decimal_metric | pim_catalog_metric           | 1                | 0                | Length        | CENTIMETER          | other |
    And the following published products:
      | sku     | decimal_price        | decimal_number | decimal_metric     |
      | sandals | 10.12 USD, 10.12 EUR | 12.1234        | 10.3456 CENTIMETER |

  Scenario: Successfully show English format numbers for English UI
    Given I am logged in as "Julia"
    When I show the "sandals" published product
    Then the field decimal_price should contain "10.12"
    And the field decimal_number should contain "12.1234"
    And the field decimal_metric should contain "10.3456"

  Scenario: Successfully show French format numbers for French UI
    Given I am logged in as "Julien"
    When I show the "sandals" published product
    Then the field [decimal_price] should contain "10,12"
    And the field [decimal_number] should contain "12,1234"
    And the field [decimal_metric] should contain "10,3456"
