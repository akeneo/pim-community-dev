    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Display a message when try to delete none product
    Given I press mass-delete button
    Then I should see flash message "No product selected"

  Scenario: Successfully remove many products
    Given I mass-delete products boots_S36, boots_S37 and boots_S38
    Then I should see the text "Are you sure you want to delete selected products?"
    When I confirm the removal
    Then I should not see products boots_S36, product boots_S37 and boots_S38
    And the grid should contain 8 elements

  Scenario: Successfully "mass" delete one product
    Given I mass-delete product boots_S38
    Then I should see the text "Are you sure you want to delete selected products?"
    When I confirm the removal
    Then I should not see product boots_S38
    And the grid should contain 10 elements

  Scenario: Successfully mass delete visible products
    Given I sort by "SKU" value ascending
    And I select all visible products
    Then I press mass-delete button
    And I should see the text "Are you sure you want to delete selected products?"
    When I confirm the removal
    Then the grid should contain 1 element
    And I should see product sneakers_S43

  Scenario: Successfully mass delete all products
    Given I select all products
    Then I press mass-delete button
    And I should see the text "Are you sure you want to delete selected products?"
    When I confirm the removal
    Then the grid should contain 0 elements

    And I launched the completeness calculator

    And I filter by "Complete" with value "yes"
    And I select all visible products
    When I press mass-delete button
    Then I should see the text "Are you sure you want to delete selected products?"
    When I confirm the removal
