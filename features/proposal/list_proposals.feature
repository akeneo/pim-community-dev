Feature: List proposals
  In order to easily view, approve and refuse proposals
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to view a list of all proposals

  Background:
    Given an "apparel" catalog configuration
    And the following category accesses:
      | category        | user group | access |
      | 2014_collection | Redactor   | edit   |
      | 2015_collection | Redactor   | edit   |
      | 2015_collection | Manager    | edit   |
    And the following products:
      | sku     | family   | categories      |
      | tshirt  | tshirts  | 2014_collection |
      | sweater | sweaters | 2014_collection |
      | jacket  | jackets  | 2015_collection |
    And Mary proposed the following change to "tshirt":
      | field | value          |
      | Name  | Summer t-shirt |
    And Sandra proposed the following change to "sweater":
      | field | value          |
      | Name  | Winter sweater |
    And Julia proposed the following change to "jacket":
      | field | value         |
      | Name  | Autumn jacket |

  Scenario: Successfully sort and filter proposals in the grid
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    And I am on the proposals page
    Then the grid should contain 3 elements
    And the rows should be sorted descending by proposed at
    And I should be able to sort the rows by author and proposed at
    And I should be able to use the following filters:
      | filter | value       | result          |
      | Author | Julia       | jacket          |
      | Author | Sandra,Mary | sweater, tshirt |

  Scenario: Successfully approve or refuse a proposal
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    And I am on the proposals page
    Then the grid should contain 3 elements
    And I should see entities tshirt, sweater and jacket
    When I click on the "Approve" action of the row which contains "tshirt"
    Then I should see a flash message "The proposal has been applied successfully."
    And the grid should contain 2 elements
    When I click on the "Refuse" action of the row which contains "jacket"
    Then I should see a flash message "The proposal has been refused."
    And the grid should contain 1 element

  Scenario: Successfully display only proposals that the current user can approve
    Given I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the proposals page
    Then the grid should contain 2 elements
    And I should see entities tshirt and sweater
