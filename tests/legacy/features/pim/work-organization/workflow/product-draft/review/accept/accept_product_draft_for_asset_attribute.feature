Feature: Review a product draft
  In order to control which data should be applied to a product
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to review a product draft

    And the product:

  @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-3980
  Scenario: Successfully accept a multiselect attribute from a product draft
    Given I am logged in as "Mary"
    And I edit the "my-jacket" product
    And I press the "Send for approval" button
    And I press the "Send" button in the popin
    And I logout
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I edit the "my-jacket" product
    When I visit the "Proposals" column tab
    Then I should see the text "Photo of a paint."
    And I should see the text "Architectural bridge of a city..."
    And I should see the text "A big machine"
