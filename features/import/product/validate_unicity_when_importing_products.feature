Feature: Validate values for unique attributes when importing products
  In order to keep catalog data consistent
  As a product manager
  I need to be sure that unique constraints are applied during product import

  Background:
    Given an "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | code                  | type   | group     | unique | scopable | localizable | useable_as_grid_filter |
      | test_unique_attribute | text   | marketing | yes    | no       | no          | yes                    |
      | date                  | date   | marketing | yes    | no       | no          | yes                    |
      | number                | number | marketing | yes    | no       | no          | yes                    |
      | text                  | text   | marketing | yes    | no       | no          | yes                    |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Successfully ignore duplicate unique date values
    Given the following CSV file to import:
      """
      sku;date
      SKU-001;2014-01-01
      SKU-002;2014-01-01
      """
    And the following job "csv_footwear_product_import" configuration:

    When I am on the "csv_footwear_product_import" import job page
    And I launch the import job
    And I wait for the "product_import" job to finish
    Then I should see the text "The value 2014-01-01 is already set on another product for the unique attribute date"
    And there should be 1 product

  Scenario: Successfully ignore duplicate unique number values
    Given the following CSV file to import:
      """

    And I wait for the "product_import" job to finish
    Then I should see the text "The value 123 is already set on another product for the unique attribute number"
    And there should be 1 product

  Scenario: Successfully ignore duplicate unique text values
    Given the following CSV file to import:
      """

    And I wait for the "product_import" job to finish
    Then I should see the text "The value foo is already set on another product for the unique attribute text"
    And there should be 1 product

  @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-3309
  Scenario: Import a file with same value in unique attribute and with existing product with this value
