  In order to be able to use unique attribute at the right places

    And the following attribute:

  Scenario: Successfully hide unique attributes on product mass edit
    Given I am on the products grid

      | family | Boots  |
    And I press the "Save" button in the popin
    And I wait to be on the "a_boot" product page
    And I am on the products grid
    And I select rows a_boot
    And I press the "Bulk actions" button
    When I choose the "Edit common attributes" operation
