Akeneo PIM Application

Installation instructions
-------------------------
To install Akeneo PIM for a PIM project or for evaluation, please follow:
http://docs.akeneo.com/installation/installation_workstation.html

The following installation overview is for contributing to Akeneo PIM, not for project purpose.

## Installation overview
* Make sure all requirements are fullfilled
* Install files and DB content:

````
    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ git clone git@github.com:akeneo/pim-community-dev.git
    $ cd pim-community-dev
    $ php ../composer.phar install
    $ php app/console pim:install --env=dev
    $ php app/console cache:clear --env=dev
````

* Create a VirtualHost pointing to your pim-community-dev/web directory and a matching hostname
* Go to http://<my-hostname>/app_dev.php to access your dev environment

Note: using the "--prefer-dist" option on composer install can speed up
the installation by looking into your local Composer cache.

Note: The pim:install command can be executed several times if you need to reinit your db or redeploy your assets.
You just have to use the `--force` option.
By default, this script initializes the dev environment.

### Add translation packs (optional)

You can download translation packs from crowdin: http://crowdin.net/project/akeneo

The Akeneo PIM archive contains the following directories tree: `<locale>/<version>/<translation_directories>`
You just have to paste the <translation_directories> in your app/Resources/ directory.

- app/cache
- app/logs
- app/entities
