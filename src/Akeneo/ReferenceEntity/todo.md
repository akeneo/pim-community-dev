- See if it's possible to have the routing declared only in our bundle (we will see later with black hawks how to do it)
- Application/ReferenceEntity/Show/ShowReferenceEntityHandler should handle only one command it should maybe return only a ReadModel
- Discuss about Domain/Model/ReferenceEntity/ReferenceEntity getters: they break the tell don't ask principle.
- rename Domain/Model/ReferenceEntity/ReferenceEntityIdentifier:fromString to create: we cannot create them another way
- Move the InMemory repository in the business code
- Create builders for entities in the backend
- Create LabelCollection from outside the domain object ReferenceEntity
- What to do in a show command handler if the entity is not found? Throw an exception? null?
- Should we use "list" or "index"? Should we use "get" or "show"? In a lot of places we use one or the other. Could be nice to choose before it's getting too messy
- add normalizer for reference entity
- test integration controller edit
- add pqb filter, grid filter and peb filter for the reference entity value
- Add remaining ACLs
- Change read models to enforce properties are coherent (front)
- switch the rest of entities to models for the views (like attribute edit) (front)
- switch from image to files (rework on the attribute model)
- split create and edit model in files
- add acceptance test for attribute edit validation (front)
- for imports of attributes (case never happens with UI): Add validation of editCommands depending on the property updated, check the type (text/image) if it's supported (today an error is thrown saying it didn't find an updater by the registry)
  (See validation of "Akeneo\ReferenceEntity\Application\Attribute\EditAttribute\CommandFactory\EditValidationRuleCommand" and the primary constraint) (back)
- rework constructors to receive domain models (label collection)
- fix the reference entity field on the pef to be able to search when the search will work (front)
- PIM-7677: Better storage management. https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-7677
- Add builder for our backend tests
