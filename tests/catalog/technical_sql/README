This folder contains a database backup of the technical catalog + three products:
- one empty enabled
- one empty disabled
- one with all possible attributes

You can use this catalog when you don't want your tests to depend on the loading of the CSV files. The most common
use case is when you want to test directly the result of something you have in database.

For instance, let's say we want to test the normalization of a product to the standard format. If we rely on the CSV
files, and if there is a bug in the way we store products (wrong format for the double for instance),
the result of the normalization could be a false positive. By using directly this database backup,
we are sure the data are reliable. Which means our test is reliable too.
