Feature: Filter products by text field
  In order to filter products by text attributes in the catalog
  As a regular user
  I need to be able to filter products in the catalog

  Background:
    Given the "default" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Mary"

  Scenario: Successfully filter products with special characters value for text attribute
    Given the following attribute:
      | label-en_US | type             | useable_as_grid_filter | localizable | group | code |
      | name        | pim_catalog_text | 1                      | 1           | other | name |
    And the following products:
      | sku      | name-en_US                     |
      | 11026270 | HP LA2206xc + WF722A           |

      | 135-2541 | Canon 5D + EF 25-15 FL         |
    When I am on the products page
    And I display the columns SKU, Name, Family, Complete, Created at and Updated at
    Then I should see products "HP LA2206xc + WF722A", "Canon 5D + EF 24-105 F4L IS", "Canon 5D + EF 24-105mm f/4L IS" and "Canon 5D + EF 24-105 F5L IS"
