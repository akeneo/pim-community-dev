- Change the channel switcher and collapse/expand modes on product edit view
- Add a loading mask when loading quick creation form
- Allow to switch configuration between ORM and ODM
- Update OroPlatform from beta-1 to beta-5

## Bug fixes
- Missing pending versionable entities
- Product edit form fails with memory limit for products contained in large groups
- When I delete a filter price or metric and add it again, the filter is not applied
- Translate metric units in select field
- Values of attributes with the type Number are displayed with .0000 on product edit
- Reduce metric field width
- Sort by metric value in product datagrid
- Constraint of unicity for products of a variant group
- When reimporting a product, history for this product shows Create instead of Update
- The completness calculation takes a lot of time after importing in IcecatDemo
- Apply select2 only on needed fields
- Inverse unit and data position for metric form field
- Unwanted popin when try to leave attribute edit view
- Display bug on channel selector with long labels
- Versioning is not called after import
- I can select a root of a tree in the mass-edit wizard
- Products with no completeness do not show in the grid when selecting All products
- Exporting products with an empty file attribute value fails
- The count of Write when I export products is wrong
- Attributes are created even with minimal install
- Error on disallowed decimal on price are not displayed at the right place
- Initial state of completeness filter is wrong
- Search should take account of ACLs
- Oro mapping issue with serch item on beta-1
- Locale selector in the product header is sometimes too short

## BC breaks
- Change AbstractAttribute getters that return a boolean value to use the 'is' prefix instead of 'get'. The affected getters are 'getScopable', 'getTranslatable', 'getRequired', 'getUnique'.
- Product, ProductValue, Media and ProductPrice have switched from Pim\Bundle\CatalogBundle\Entity namespace to the Pim\Bundle\CatalogBundle\Model namespace, to pave the way for the MongoDB implementation
- AbstractEntityFlexible getValue method now returns null in place of false when there is now value related to attribute + locale + scope
- Completeness and Product are not linked any more via a Doctrine relationship. We are cutting the links between Product and other entities in order to pave the way to the ability to switch between MongoDB and ORM while using the same API (apart from Product repository).
- Remove PimDataAuditBundle
- Remode PimDemoBundle
- Move product metric in catalog bundle
- Change jobs.yml to batch_jobs.yml and change expected format to add services and parameters
