    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following product:
      | sku           | categories |
      | akeneo_tshirt | tshirts    |

  Scenario: Successfully add a draft without add attribute in product
    Given I should get the following product drafts after apply the following updater to it:
      | product       | actions                                                                                                  | result | username |
      | akeneo_tshirt | [{"type": "set_data", "field": "release_date", "data": "2014-02-18", "locale": null, "scope": "mobile"}] | {}     | Mary     |
    And I should get the following proposals:
      | product        | username | result                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
      | akeneo_tshirt  | Mary     | {"values": {"release_date": [{"locale": null, "scope": "mobile", "data": "2014-02-18T00:00:00+01:00"}]}, "review_statuses": {"release_date": [{"locale": null, "scope": "mobile", "status": "draft"}]}} |
    And the product "akeneo_tshirt" should have the following values:
      | release_date-mobile | |

      | product       | attribute     | value      | scope  |
