Feature: Expose product data via a REST API
  In order to provide access to product data to an external application
  As a developer
  I need to expose product data via a REST API

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following product:
      | sku     | name-en_US | description-en_US-mobile | description-en_US-tablet | price-EUR | price-USD | categories      |
      | sandals | My sandals | My great sandals         | My great new sandals     | 20        | 30        | 2014_collection |

  Scenario: Fail to authenticate an anonymous user
    Given I send a GET request to "api/rest/products/sandals.json"
    Then the response code should be 401

  Scenario: Successfully authenticate a user
    Given I am authenticating as "admin" with "admin_api_key" api key
    And I send a GET request to "api/rest/products/sandals.json"
    Then the response code should be 200

  Scenario: Successfully retrieve a product
    Given I am authenticating as "admin" with "admin_api_key" api key
    And I request information for product "sandals"
    Then the response code should be 200
    And the response should be valid json
    And the response should contain json:
    """
    {

      "groups":[],
      "categories":["2014_collection"],
