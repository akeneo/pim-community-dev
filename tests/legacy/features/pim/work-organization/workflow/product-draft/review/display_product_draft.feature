    And the product:
      | family                   | jackets           |
      | categories               | winter_top        |

  # @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-3980
  Scenario: Successfully display the original value in the copy panel
    Given Mary proposed the following change to "my-jacket":
      | field | value       | tab                 |
      | SKU   | your-jacket | Product information |
    And I am logged in as "Mary"
    And I edit the "my-jacket" product
    And I open the comparison panel
    And I switch the comparison locale to "en_US"
    And I switch the comparison scope to "mobile"
    And I switch the comparison source to "working_copy"
    Then the SKU comparison value should be "my-jacket"

  Scenario: Successfully display the original value in the copy panel where there is no modifications
    Given Mary proposed the following change to "my-jacket":
      | field | value       | tab                 |
      | SKU   | your-jacket | Product information |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I edit the "my-jacket" product
    And I fill in the following information:
      | SKU | your-jacket |
    Then I save the product
    When I visit the "Proposals" column tab
    Then I should see the text "The value \"your-jacket\" is the same between the proposal and the working copy."

  # @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-6935
