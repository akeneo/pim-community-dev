Feature: Update product history when rules are executed
  In order to know what changes to products were made by rules
  As a regular user
  I need to see the history of product updates performed by rules

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And I add the "french" locale to the "mobile" channel
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the products page
    And I create a new product
    And I fill in the following information in the popin:
      | SKU             | converse-sneakers |
      | Choose a family | Sneakers          |
    And I press the "Save" button in the popin
    And I wait to be on the "converse-sneakers" product page
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Name        | Black sneakers         |
      | Description | Classic black sneakers |
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
