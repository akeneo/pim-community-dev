Feature: Display warning message on attributes coming from rules on variant attribute edit
  In order to warn the user about rule attributes overriding
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to see attributes updated by rules on variant group edit

  Background:
    Given a "apparel" catalog configuration
    And the following variant group values:
      | group   | attribute    | value            | locale | scope     |
      | tshirts | manufacturer | american_apparel |        |           |
      | tshirts | name         | a                | en_US  |           |
      | tshirts | description  | e                | en_US  | ecommerce |
    And the following product rules:
      | code            | priority |
      | set_description | 10       |
    And the following product rule conditions:
      | rule            | field | operator | value          | locale | scope |
      | set_description | name  | =        | My nice tshirt | en_US  |       |
    And the following product rule setter actions:
      | rule            | field       | value                 | locale | scope     |
      | set_description | description | une belle description | fr_FR  | ecommerce |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the "tshirts" variant group page
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab

  @unstable
  Scenario: Successfully see the rule icon
    Then I should see the Name and Description fields
    Then I should see the smart icon for the attribute "Description"
    And I display the tooltip for the "Description" rule icon
    Then I should see "set_description" in the popover
