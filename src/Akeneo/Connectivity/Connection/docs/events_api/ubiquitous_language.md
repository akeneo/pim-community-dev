* **Event Subscription**

    The configuration includes a destination URL and a "secret" (to verify the requests authenticity).

* **PIM Event**

    Lifecycle event of the PIM entities.

    Like `product.created` for the creation of a new Product.

* **API Event**

    Event sent by the Events API to an Event Subscription while respecting the Connection permissions.

    It contains the PIM Event informations as well as the full event data following the Events API specifications.

    For example, for a `product.created` event, it will contains the whole Product data with the permissions of the Connection applied to it.

* **API Event Type**

    Event Type identify each kind of API Event offered through the Events API.

    For example `product.updated`, `product.removed`, `product_model.created`.

* **Events API request**

    Request sent to an Event Subscription URL, it contains a collection of API Events as well as the required headers to valid the Request authenticity (signature, timestamp).

* **Bulk**

* **Queue**

    The Queue allows to store & send Messages to another process to be handled asynchronously at a later time.
