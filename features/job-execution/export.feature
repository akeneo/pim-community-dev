Feature: Export profiles
  In order to easily export profiles
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to see the result of an export and to download logs, files and archives

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following job "xlsx_footwear_association_type_export" configuration:
      | filePath     | %tmp%/xlsx_footwear_association_type_export/xlsx_footwear_association_type_export.xlsx |
      | linesPerFile | 3                                                                                      |
    And I am logged in as "Peter"
