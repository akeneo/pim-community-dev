Feature: Display the completeness of a product with reference data
  In order to see the completeness of a product with reference data in the catalog
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to display the completeness of a product

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And I add the "french" locale to the "tablet" channel
    And I add the "french" locale to the "mobile" channel
    And the following attributes:
      | code        | label-en_US | localizable | scopable | type                            | reference_data_name | group |
      | heel_fabric | Heel fabric | 1           | 1        | pim_reference_data_multiselect  | fabrics             | other |
      | main_fabric | Main fabric | 0           | 1        | pim_reference_data_multiselect  | fabrics             | other |
      | main_color  | Main color  | 1           | 0        | pim_reference_data_simpleselect | color               | other |
    And the following family:
      | code      | attributes                                                    | requirements-tablet                   | requirements-mobile                    |
      | highheels | sku,heel_color,sole_fabric,heel_fabric,main_fabric,main_color | sku,heel_color,sole_fabric,main_color | sku,heel_fabric,main_fabric,main_color |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And the following "main_fabric" attribute reference data: PVC, Nylon, Neoprene, Spandex, Wool, Kevlar, Jute
    And the following "main_color" attribute reference data: Red, Green, Light green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, Black, White
    And the following products:

      | high-heels  | highheels |            |             |                          |                          |                          |                          |                    |                    |                  |                  |
    And I launched the completeness calculator

  Scenario: Successfully display the completeness of the products with reference data
    Given I am on the "red-heels" product page
    When I open the "Completeness" panel
    Then I should see the completeness:

      | mobile  | en_US  | warning | 50%   |
      | tablet  | en_US  | warning | 50%   |

    Given I am on the products page
    And I switch the locale to "en_US"
    And I filter by "scope" with operator "equals" and value "Mobile"
    Then the row "red-heels" should contain:
      | column   | value |
      | complete | 50%   |

      | complete | 50%   |
    Then the row "high-heels" should contain:
      | column   | value |
      | complete | 25%   |
    And I filter by "scope" with operator "equals" and value "Tablet"
    Then the row "red-heels" should contain:
      | column   | value |
      | complete | 50%   |
    Then the row "black-heels" should contain:
      | column   | value |
