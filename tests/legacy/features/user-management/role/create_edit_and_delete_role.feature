Feature: Create and delete a user role
  In order to manage the users and rights
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to create, edit and delete user roles

  Background:
    Given the "default" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Peter"

  Scenario: Successfully create, edit and delete a user role
    Given I am on the role creation page
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Role | Dummy role |
    When I save the role
    And I should see the text "Dummy role"
    When I edit the "Dummy role" role
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Role | VeryDummyRole |
    When I save the role
    Then I should see the text "VeryDummyRole"
    When I am on the role index page
    Then I should see roles "Administrator, VeryDummyRole"
    And I click on the "Delete" action of the row which contains "VeryDummyRole"
    Then I should see a confirm dialog with the following content:
      | title   | Confirm deletion                           |
      | content | Are you sure you want to delete this role? |
    When I confirm the deletion
    Then I should not see role "VeryDummyRole"
    When I click on the "Delete" action of the row which contains "Administrator"
    And I cancel the deletion
    And I should see role "Administrator"
