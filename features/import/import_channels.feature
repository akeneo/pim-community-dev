Feature: Import channels
  In order to setup my application
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to import channels

  Scenario: Successfully import new channel in CSV
    Given the "footwear" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And the following CSV file to import:
      """

      site;Site;USD,EUR;de_DE,en_US,hy_AM;2014_collection;"weight: GRAM, length: MILLIMETER, volume: LITER"
      """
    And the following job "csv_footwear_channel_import" configuration:
      | filePath | %file to import% |
    When I am on the "csv_footwear_channel_import" import job page
    And I launch the import job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_channel_import" job to finish
    Then there should be the following channels:
      | code | label-en_US | currencies | locales           | tree            | conversion_units                           |
