Feature: Associate a product
  In order to create associations between products and groups
  As a product manager
  I need to associate a product to other products and groups

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following product groups:
      | code              | label-en_US      | type    |
      | caterpillar_boots | Caterpillar boots| RELATED |
    And the following products:
      | sku            | categories        |
      | charcoal-boots | Summer_collection |
      | black-boots    |                   |
      | gray-boots     |                   |
      | brown-boots    |                   |
      | green-boots    |                   |
      | shoelaces      |                   |
      | glossy-boots   |                   |
