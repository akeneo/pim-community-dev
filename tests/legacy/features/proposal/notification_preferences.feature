Feature: Manage notifications preferences
  In order to keep my productivity and don't be spammed by notifications
  As a regular user
  I need to be able to manage notifications I receive about product draft proposals

  Background:
    Given an "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following product category accesses:
      | product category | user group | access |
      | 2014_collection  | Redactor   | edit   |
      | 2014_collection  | Manager    | own    |
      | 2014_collection  | IT support | view   |
    And the following products:
      | sku    | family  | categories      |
      | tshirt | jackets | 2014_collection |

    Given I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the User profile show page
    And I press the "Edit" button
