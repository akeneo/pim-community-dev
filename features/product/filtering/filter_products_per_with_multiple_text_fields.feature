    And I am logged in as "Mary"

  Scenario: Successfully filter products with the sames attributes
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Description"
    And I filter by "Description" with value "red"
    And I show the filter "Name"
    And I filter by "Name" with value "green"
    Then the grid should contain 3 elements
    And I should see entities "MUG-2" and "MUG-3" and "MUG-4"
    And I hide the filter "Description"
    And I hide the filter "Name"

  Scenario: Successfully filter product without commons attributes
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Description"
    And I filter by "Description" with value "black"
    And I show the filter "Name"
    And I filter by "Name" with value "green"
    Then the grid should contain 0 elements
    And I hide the filter "Description"
    And I hide the filter "Name"

  Scenario: Successfully filter only one product
    Given I am on the products page
    And I show the filter "Description"
    And I filter by "Description" with value "white"
    And I show the filter "Name"
    And I filter by "Name" with value "green"
    Then the grid should contain 1 elements
    And I should see entities "MUG-1"
    And I hide the filter "Description"
    And I hide the filter "Name"
