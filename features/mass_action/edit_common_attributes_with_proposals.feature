  Scenario: Successfully creates proposal on editable products
    Given I am logged in as "Mary"
    And I am on the products page
    When I mass-edit products viewable, editable and owned
    And I choose the "Edit common attributes" operation
    And I should see available attributes Name, Manufacturer and Description in group "Product information"
    And I display the Name attribute
    And I change the "Name" to "My awesome name"
    And I move on to the next step
    And I wait for the "edit-common-attributes" mass-edit job to finish
    Then I should see the text "Proposal created 1"
    And I should see the text "skipped products 1"
    And I should see the text "processed 1"
    When I logout
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I edit the "viewable" product
    And I visit the "Proposals" tab
    Then the grid should contain 0 elements
    When I edit the "editable" product
    And I visit the "Proposals" tab
    Then I should see the text "A draft is in progress by Mary for this product"
    And the grid should contain 1 elements
    When I edit the "owned" product
    And I visit the "Proposals" tab
    Then the grid should contain 0 elements
