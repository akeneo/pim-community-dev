Feature: Quick export many products with localized attributes from datagrid
  In order to quick export a set of products
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to display products I want and export them

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following products:
      | sku      | family   | categories        | name-en_US    | price                | size | color | weight      | rate_sale | destocking_date |
      | boots    | boots    | winter_collection | Amazing boots | 20.80 EUR, 25.35 USD | 40   | black | 250 GRAM    | 75.5      | 1999-12-28      |
      | sneakers | sneakers | summer_collection | Sneakers      | 50.00 EUR, 60.00 USD | 42   | white | 125.50 GRAM | 75.00     |                 |
      | sandals  | sandals  | summer_collection | Sandals       | 5 EUR, 5 USD         | 40   | red   | 0.5 GRAM    | 75        |                 |
      | pump     |          | summer_collection | Pump          | 15 EUR, 20 USD       | 41   | blue  |             |           |                 |
    And I am logged in as "Julien"

  Scenario: Successfully quick export products with localized attributes
    Given I am on the products page
    And I select rows boots, sneakers, sandals and pump
    Then I press "CSV (tous les attributs)" on the "Export rapide" dropdown button
    And I wait for the quick export to finish
    When I am on the dashboard page
    Then I should have 1 new notification
    And I should see notification:
      | type    | message                                                  |
      | success | Exportation rapide CSV product quick export est terminée |
    Then I go on the last executed job resume of "csv_product_quick_export"
    And I should see "TERMINÉ"
    And the path of the exported file of "csv_product_quick_export" should be "/tmp/products_export_en_US_mobile.csv"
    And exported file of "csv_product_quick_export" should contain:
    """
