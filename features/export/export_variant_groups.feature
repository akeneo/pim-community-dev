Feature: Export variant groups
  In order to be able to access and modify groups data outside PIM
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export variant groups

  Scenario: Successfully export variant groups
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following job "csv_footwear_variant_group_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/variant_group_export/variant_group_export.csv |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the "csv_footwear_variant_group_export" export job page
    When I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_variant_group_export" job to finish
    Then I should see "Read 1"
    And I should see "Written 1"
    And exported file of "csv_footwear_variant_group_export" should contain:
    """
    code;axis;label-en_US;type
    caterpillar_boots;color,size;"Caterpillar boots";VARIANT
    """

  Scenario: Successfully export variant groups with attributes
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following attribute:
      | code       | type             | allowed_extensions | group |
      | attachment | pim_catalog_file | txt                | other |
    And the following variant group values:
      | group             | attribute          | value                 | locale | scope  |
      | caterpillar_boots | manufacturer       | Caterpillar           |        |        |
