Feature: Validate price attributes of a product
  In order to keep my data consistent
  As Julia
  I need to be able to see validation errors for price attributes

  Background:
    Given the "default" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | code    | label-en_US | type   | scopable | negative_allowed | decimals_allowed | number_min | number_max |
      | cost    | Cost        | prices | no       | no               | no               |            |            |
      | price   | Price       | prices | yes      | no               | no               |            |            |
      | tax     | Tax         | prices | no       |                  | yes              | 10         | 100        |
      | customs | Customs     | prices | yes      |                  | yes              | 10         | 100        |
    And the following family:
      | code | label-en_US | attributes                     |
      | baz  | Baz         | sku, cost, price, tax, customs |
    And the following product:
      | sku | family |
      | foo | baz    |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the "foo" product page

  Scenario: Validate the negative allowed constraint of price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Cost" to "-10"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should be 0 or more."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red

  Scenario: Validate the negative allowed constraint of scopable price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Price" to "-10"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should be 0 or more."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red

  Scenario: Validate the decimals allowed constraint of price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Cost" to "2.7"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should not be a decimal."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red

  Scenario: Validate the decimals allowed constraint of scopable price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Price" to "4.9"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should not be a decimal."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red

  Scenario: Validate the number min constraint of price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Tax" to "5.5"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should be 10.0000 or more."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red

  Scenario: Validate the number min constraint of scopable price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Customs" to "9.9"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should be 10.0000 or more."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red

  Scenario: Validate the number max constraint of price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Tax" to "110"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should be 100.0000 or less."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red

  Scenario: Validate the number max constraint of scopable price attribute
    Given I change the "$ Customs" to "222.2"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see validation tooltip "This value should be 100.0000 or less."
    And I should see validation tooltip "There are errors in this tab!"
    And the "Attributes" tab should be red
