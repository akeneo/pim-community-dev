Feature: Display the completeness of a product
  In order to see the completeness of a product in the catalog
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to display the completeness of a product

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And I add the "french" locale to the "tablet" channel
    And I add the "french" locale to the "mobile" channel
    And the following products:
      | sku      | family   | manufacturer | weather_conditions | color | name-en_US | name-fr_FR  | price          | rating | size | lace_color  |
      | sneakers | sneakers | Converse     | hot                | blue  | Sneakers   | Espadrilles | 69 EUR, 99 USD | 4      | 43   | laces_white |
      | sandals  | sandals  |              |                    | white |            | Sandales    |                |        |      |             |
    And the following product values:
      | product  | attribute   | value                 | locale | scope  |
      | sneakers | description | Great sneakers        | en_US  | mobile |
      | sneakers | description | Really great sneakers | en_US  | tablet |
      | sneakers | description | Grandes espadrilles   | fr_FR  | mobile |
      | sandals  | description | Super sandales        | fr_FR  | tablet |
      | sandals  | description | Super sandales        | fr_FR  | mobile |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I launched the completeness calculator

  Scenario: Successfully display the completeness of the products
    Given I am on the "sneakers" product page
    When I open the "Completeness" panel
    Then I should see the "en_US" completeness in position 1
    And The completeness "fr_FR" should be closed
    And The completeness "en_US" should be opened
    And I should see the completeness:
      | channel | locale | state   | missing_values         | ratio |
      | mobile  | en_US  | success |                        | 100%  |

      | tablet  | fr_FR  | warning | Description, Side view | 78%   |
    When I am on the products page
    Then I am on the "sandals" product page
    And the Name field should be highlighted
    And the Description field should be highlighted
    And the Manufacturer field should not be highlighted

    And the Product information group should be highlighted
    And the Marketing group should be highlighted

    And The completeness "fr_FR" should be closed
    And The completeness "en_US" should be opened
    When I switch the locale to "fr_FR"
    Then I should see the "fr_FR" completeness in position 1
    And The completeness "en_US" should be closed
    And The completeness "fr_FR" should be opened
    And I should see the completeness:
      | channel | locale | state   | missing_values                                                | ratio |
