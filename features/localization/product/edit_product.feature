  In order to enrich the catalog
  As a regular user

  Background:
    Given the "default" catalog configuration
    And the following attribute groups:
      | code    | label-en_US |
      | general | General     |
    And the following attributes:
      | code   | label-fr_FR | type   | scopable | unique | negative_allowed | decimals_allowed | group | metric_family | default_metric_unit |
      | number | Nombre      | number | no       | no     | yes              | yes              | other |               |                     |
      | weight | Poids       | metric | no       | no     | yes              | yes              | other | Weight        | GRAM                |

    And the following family:
      | code | label-en_US | attributes                       |
      | baz  | Baz         | sku, number, weight, price, date |
    And the following products:
      | sku | family | number  | weight        | price-EUR | date       |
      | foo | baz    | -12.5   | 150.8675 GRAM | 1000.50   | 2015-05-28 |

    Then the field Nombre should contain "-25,75"
    And the product "foo" should have the following values:

    And I save the product
    Then the field Poids should contain "151"
    And the product "foo" should have the following values:
      | weight | 151.0000 GRAM |

  Scenario: Successfully view and edit localized price
    Given I am on the "foo" product page
    Then the field Prix should contain "1000,50"
    When I change the "Prix" to "1200,50 EUR"
    And I save the product
    Then the field Prix should contain "1200,50"

    Then the field Date should contain "28/05/2015"
    When I change the "Date" to "01/12/2015"
    And I save the product
    Then the field Date should contain "01/12/2015"
    And the product "foo" should have the following values:
      | date | 2015-12-01 |

  Scenario: Switching locale should change the displayed format
    When I am on the User profile edit page
    And I visit the "Interfaces" tab
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Langue de l'interface | anglais (Royaume-Uni) |
    And I save the user
    And I am on the "foo" product page
    Then the field Date should contain "28/05/2015"

  Scenario: Successfully show datetimepicker in my UI locale
    Given I am on the "foo" product page
    When I click on the field Date
    Then I should see the text "Mai"
    And I should see the text "Lu"
