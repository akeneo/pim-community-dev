Feature: Export products according to multi select values
  In order to use the enriched product data
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to export the products according to their multi selected options

  Background:
    Given the "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following products:
      | sku    | family | name-en_US | weather_conditions | categories      |
      | BOOT-1 | boots  | The boot 1 |                    | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-2 | boots  | The boot 2 | dry                | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-3 | boots  | The boot 3 | dry, wet           | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-4 | boots  | The boot 4 | snowy              | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-5 | boots  | The boot 5 | snowy              | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-6 | boots  | The boot 6 | cold               | 2014_collection |
      | BOOT-7 | boots  | The boot 7 |                    | 2014_collection |
    And the following job "csv_footwear_product_export" configuration:
      | filePath | %tmp%/product_export/footwear_product_export.csv |

  Scenario: Export only the product values with selected options
    Given I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the "csv_footwear_product_export" export job edit page
    And I visit the "Content" tab
    And I add available attributes Weather conditions
    And I filter by "weather_conditions.code" with operator "In list" and value "Dry"
    And I filter by "completeness" with operator "No condition on completeness" and value ""
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes"
    When I launch the export job
    And I wait for the "csv_footwear_product_export" job to finish
    Then exported file of "csv_footwear_product_export" should contain:
