  In order to join a document to a product
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to upload it and preview it

  Background:

    And the following attribute:
      | label       | type | allowed extensions |
      | Description | file | txt                |
    And a "Car" product
    And the "Car" product has the "description" attribute
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the "Car" product page

  @javascript
  Scenario: Succesfully leave the document empty
    # Flash message is different from CE
    When I save the product
    Then I should see flash message "Product working copy has been updated"
