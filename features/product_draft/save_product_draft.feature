Feature: Save a product draft
  In order to update the product even if I'm not owner
  As a redactor
  I need to be able to save a product draft

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And the following product:
      | sku    | family | categories        | description-en_US-mobile |
      | tshirt | tees   | summer_collection | Can't touch this         |
    And I am logged in as "Mary"

  @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-4604
  Scenario: Successfully save an empty product draft value
    Given I edit the "tshirt" product
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I change the "Name" to "Dark Tshirt"
    When I save the product
    Then the product Name should be "Dark Tshirt"

  @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-4604
  Scenario: Successfully save an existing product draft value
    Given I edit the "tshirt" product
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I change the "Description" to "Yes I can"
    When I save the product
    Then the product Description should be "Yes I can"

  @jira https://akeneo.atlassian.net/browse/PIM-4597
  Scenario: Successfully show the product draft status
    Given I edit the "tshirt" product
    Then I should see the text "Draft status Working copy"
    When I change the "Description" to "Hammer time"
    And I save the product
    Then I should see the text "Draft status In progress"
    When I press the Send for approval button
    Then I should see the text "Draft status Waiting for approval"
