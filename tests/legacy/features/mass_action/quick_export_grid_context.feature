Feature: Quick export products according to the product grid context
  In order to quick export a set of products
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to display published products on the product grid and export them

  Background:
    Given a "footwear" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | label-en_US | type               | useable_as_grid_filter | metric_family | default_metric_unit | decimals_allowed | group | code   |
      | Weight      | pim_catalog_metric | 1                      | Weight        | GRAM                | 1                | other | weight |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"
    And I am on the "boots" family page
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I add available attribute Weight
    And I save the family
    And I am on the "sneakers" family page
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I add available attribute Weight
    And I save the family
    And I am on the "sandals" family page
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I add available attribute Weight
    And I save the family
    And the following published products:
      | sku      | family   | categories        | name-en_US    | price          | size | color | 123 | description-en_US-tablet | weight | weight-unit |
      | boots    | boots    | winter_collection | Amazing boots | 20 EUR, 25 USD | 40   | black | aaa | Mob                      | 20     | GRAM        |

    And I select rows boots, sneakers, pump
    When I press "CSV (Grid context)" on the "Quick Export" dropdown button
    And I wait for the "csv_published_product_grid_context_quick_export" quick export to finish
    And I am on the dashboard page
    Then I should have 1 new notification
    And I should see notification:
      | type    | message                                                               |
      | success | Quick export CSV published product quick export grid context finished |
    When I go on the last executed job resume of "csv_published_product_grid_context_quick_export"
    Then I should see the text "COMPLETED"
    And the name of the exported file of "csv_published_product_grid_context_quick_export" should be "published_products_export_grid_context_en_US_tablet.csv"
    And exported file of "csv_published_product_grid_context_quick_export" should contain:
    """
