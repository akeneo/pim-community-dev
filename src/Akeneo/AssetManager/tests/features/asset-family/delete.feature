Feature: Delete an asset family
  In order to keep my asset families up to date
  As a user
  I want to delete an asset family

  Background:
    Given a valid asset family
  @acceptance-back
  Scenario: Delete an asset family
    When the user deletes the asset family "designer"
    Then there should be no asset family "designer"

  @acceptance-back
  Scenario: User can't delete an Asset Family if it is used in any Asset Attribute on an Asset Family
    Given the following asset attributes:
      | entity_identifier | code   | labels                                 | required | read_only | order | value_per_channel | value_per_locale | asset_type |
      | designer          | mentor | {"en_US": "Mentor", "fr_FR": "Mentor"} | false    | true      | 2     | false             | false            | designer    |
    When the user deletes the asset family "designer"
    Then there should be a validation error on the property '' with message 'You can not delete this family because asset family attributes are related to this family'
    And there is an asset family "designer" with:
      | identifier | labels                                       | image |
      | designer   | {"en_US": "Designer", "fr_FR": "Concepteur"} | null  |
