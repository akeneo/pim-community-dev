    And the following family:
      | code          | attributes                                                                                                  |
      | master_family | sku,side_view,length,weather_conditions,number_in_stock,price,manufacturer,comment,available,date,file,info |
    And the following products:
      | sku      | family        |
      | boots    | master_family |
      | sneakers | master_family |
      | sandals  | master_family |
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

    And I change the "Weather conditions" to "Dry, Hot"
    And I move on to the next step
    And I wait for the "edit-common-attributes" mass-edit job to finish
    Then the options "weather_conditions" of products boots and sneakers should be:
      | value |
      | dry   |
      | hot   |
    When I am on the products page
    And I select rows boots, sandals and sneakers

    Then the options "weather_conditions" of products boots and sneakers should be:
      | value |
      |       |
